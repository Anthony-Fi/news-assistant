Russia will likely regard it as merely a new phase in the war.”</p><p>This means the general public in Europe has “to understand the necessary trade-offs involved in raising defence spending and <a

target=\"_blank\">pressured</a> to use his strong relationship with Trump to discourage him away from Kremlin talking points, and to make sure he only ends the war on terms which suit Ukraine.</p><p>But the US president is still not cracking down on Putin as much as Europe wants – suggesting the UK is still not getting the right message across.</p><p>As Jason Israel, from the Centre for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), said the number one thing Europe needs to do right now is continue “to show solidarity with Ukraine”.</p><p>He suggested that showing their long-term commitment to Kyiv would help frustrate Putin, because he has been counting on the erosion of European unity.</p></div><div><img alt=\"Keir Starmer, left, talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr

left, talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the garden of 10 Downing Street in London, Thursday Aug. 14, 2025.</div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><h2><strong>Military efforts</strong></h2><p>Europe needs to step up the military aid it sends to Ukraine, according to some specialists.</p><p>Initial plans for Starmer’s “coalition of the willing” – an organisation made up countries keen to support Ukraine against Putin’s aggression – suggested there could be as many as 30,000 troops available to provide some form of support in the event of ceasefire.</p><p>However, military chiefs have reportedly now dropped the plan and prefer a smaller, “more realistic” alternative.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/trump-prioritises-ukraine-ceasefire-peace-talks-putin-2v65qr3bf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Times </a>reported that, aside from the UK, larger European nations were concerns that it was too risky to send in that many troops in case it escalated the regional conflict.</p><p>But, as experts pointed out, one of Putin’s largest demands is for investment in Ukraine and its military to end, suggesting that’s a key concern for Russia.</p><p>CEPA senior fellow, Eitvydas Bajarunas, said Ukraine needs more defence support.</p><p>He also said that Ukraine should be “anchored” in the EU by becoming a member – and to do that, “Europe should think how to change the internal decision-making process,” he said.</p><p>He pointed to the member states who have been reluctant to allow Ukraine to join – like Hungary – and suggested overturning the unilateral decision-making process.</p><p>Other experts have suggested <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/expert-urges-coalition-of-the-willing-to-enter-ukraine-now_uk_67d7e4e7e4b09ce49e2eeb74\">going even further.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.baltdefcol.org/research-and-publications/college-publications\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In a policy brief for Estonia’s Baltic Defence College back in March, </a>Chatham House’s senior fellow Keir Giles said: “European nations can, and should, and must, steadily and incrementally build their support to Ukraine by providing what they can as soon as they can, including the overt presence of European military forces inside Ukraine.”</p><h2><strong>What might happen next?</strong></h2><p>A lot is currently hanging on what Trump manages to extract from Putin during their meeting.</p><p>There is plenty of concern that the US will follow <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/trump-pauses-us-military-aid-to-ukraine-after-zelenskyy-row_uk_67c6a31ce4b0f2b81e9f146c\">through</a> on its earlier promises and just walk away if the president does not manage to make any inroads with Russia.</p><p>But, even if he does strike some kind of deal, it’s not expected to be very favourable to Ukraine.</p><p>So one thing is certain: Europe will have to step up.</p><p>As CEPA’s director of democratic resilience <a href=\"https://cepa.org/article/unmoored-in-anchorage-europes-dangerous-game/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Greene said</a>: “If Europe again fails to seize the initiative, it will have resigned itself – and, with it, Ukraine – to living with a settlement that institutionalises instability and powerlessness. ”</p></div><!-- start relEntries --><div class=\"related-entries related-entries--thumbs related-entries--recirc yr-related-entries\"><h3

Calling the exercise “overlooked,” <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/walking-for-health/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the NHS said</a> the movement can improve your heart health and increase your stamina.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/best-step-count-a-day-health-study_uk_6881f026e4b0cde1a1cc29a0\">recent paper published in The Lancet</a> found that people who took 7,000 steps a day enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/best-step-count-a-day-health-study_uk_6881f026e4b0cde1a1cc29a0\">a 47% risk reduction</a> in all-cause mortality, with decreased likelihood of developing heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and depression.</p><p>Which begs the question: amazing as walking can be for our health, is it enough exercise on its own (ie, without <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/anti-ageing-strength-training-review_uk_6821cb70e4b09e4e8c346d21\">strength training</a>)? </p><p>We asked hospital doctor and consultant practitioner, <a href=\"https://click2pharmacy.co.uk/dr-hussain-ahmad/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Hussain Ahmad</a>, and GP <a href=\"https://www.iqdoctor.co.uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Suzanne Wylie</a> to share their thoughts.</p><h2><strong>Will walking keep me healthy if I don’t do any other exercise?</strong></h2><p>Both doctors told us that speed and duration matter.</p><p>“If you’re aiming to maintain general health, brisk walking for at least 150 minutes a week (about 30 minutes a day, five days a week) can help reduce the risk of heart disease, improve mood, and support weight management,” Dr Ahmad said.</p><p>Brisk walking – which the doctor explained “means you’re walking fast enough to feel warmer and breathe a bit harder, but still able to hold a conversation” – <a href=\"https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00230-2/fulltext\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">has been linked to</a> a 20% reduction in premature death compared to 4% for slower walkers.</p><p>Dr Wylie agreed that walking for 30 minutes a day can help us manage our stress levels and encourage better sleep. </p><p>It also “improves cardiovascular health, lowers blood pressure, reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke, supports a healthy weight, and strengthens muscles and bones, benefits that become increasingly important as we age,” she said. </p><p>Even small bouts of movement, like taking the stairs and going on a lunchtime stroll around the office, can help, the GP told us. </p><p>“For maintaining basic fitness and preventing many chronic conditions,” she stated, “brisk walking is highly effective”.</p><h2><strong>Do I have to strength train if I walk a lot?</strong></h2><p>If you want to build muscle, which is <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/best-exercise-reverseing-ageing_uk_678f7494e4b09896a6c05c56\">especially important as we age</a>, the doctors say strength training is key. </p><p>“Resistance training, balance work, or more vigorous cardio can help round out a routine,” Dr Wylie advised.</p><p>For his part, Dr Ahmad told us: “Walking alone might not be enough if you want to build muscle strength, improve balance, or boost bone density.</p><p>“For a well-rounded approach, it’s worth adding some resistance or bodyweight exercises (like squats, lunges, or push-ups) twice a week, and activities that challenge your balance and flexibility.” </p><p>Still, both experts agree that when it comes to maintaining your health, walking quickly for at least half an hour a day is remarkably effective. </p><p>After all, “The most important step is consistency: making daily movement a habit in whatever form fits your body, lifestyle, and goals,” Dr Wylie shared.</p></div><!-- start relEntries --><div class=\"related-entries related-entries--thumbs related-entries--recirc yr-related-entries\"><h3 class=\"related-entries__head\">Related...</h3><ul

The most common is a secundum ASD, which is in the middle of the wall between the atria. </p><p>Then, there’s primium ASD, also known as ostium primum defect or partial atrioventricular septal defect. That’s still in the same atrial wall, but lower down towards the bottom chambers of the heart (ventricles). </p><p>Lastly, there’s sinus venosus ASD. This is (again) in the same wall, but it’s closer to major blood vessels, which bring less oxygenated blood back to the heart. </p><p>It can happen either at the top or the bottom of the atrial wall. </p><p>ASDs are congenital, meaning people with a hole in their heart were born that way.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-septal-defect/symptoms-causes/syc-20369715\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">It happens when </a>the baby’s heart develops in the womb.</p><h2><strong>How does a hole in your heart affect your health? </strong></h2><p>It depends.

I try so hard to be present and loving, but right now it feels like I’m not the parent she wants.”</p><p>As children try to exert as much independence as possible – moving about unaided, eating their own dinner and playing alone – they might also start to lean towards one parent (and away from the other).</p><p>If you’re ‘the shunned one’, you might find your toddler doesn’t want you to hug or touch them, or even read to or play with them anymore.</p><p>While it can be pretty soul-destroying, <a href=\"https://www.rachelmelvillethomas.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel Melville-Thomas</a>, a child and adolescent psychotherapist, said it won’t last forever.

In same gender couples, the toddler might identify with the parent most like them – for example, the lively physical parent, or the quiet cuddly one – and then pull away from the other.”</p><p>But when children reach about three years old, the reverse can happen, she adds – so the opposite gender or different personality parent becomes very exciting all of a sudden.</p></div><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/63ee0b7a230000330028b3f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale\" /></div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><h2><strong>How to cope if you’re the rejected parent</strong></h2><p>While it’s nice to know it’s nothing personal, it can still suck if your child won’t even let you cuddle them after you’ve previously been so close.</p><p>“Try not to take it personally and see the big picture of a toddler’s view of the world – it will change,” said Rachel Melville-Thomas.</p><p>So what can you do in the meantime? Dunya Poltorak, a paediatric medical psychologist in Michigan, told NY Times we should listen to our child’s preferences, so if they refuse to hug you, just accept it. It’s really important to not take it personally or to show it bothers you.</p><p>You can also see the plus side. A child showing they’re comfortable rejecting a parent means they’re securely attached – so your child knows the love you have for them is unconditional, according to Dr Heard-Garris.</p><p>If you’re the parent who’s currently flavour of the month, there are things you can be doing to support your partner. Accept the situation for the time being, advised Melville-Thomas, while speaking warmly of the other parent, and gently encouraging the toddler to enjoy some time – whether that’s storytime, singing or play – with the other parent.</p></div><!-- start relEntries --><div class=\"related-entries related-entries--thumbs related-entries--recirc yr-related-entries\"><h3 class=\"related-entries__head\">Related...</h3><ul class=\"related-entries__list\"><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/tips-for-raising-young-children-from-a-therapist_uk_63db730fe4b04d4d18ea694e\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/63dba7632400003a004a314c.jpeg\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/tips-for-raising-young-children-from-a-therapist_uk_63db730fe4b04d4d18ea694e\">7 Small Parenting Wins That Will Actually Make A Difference With Your Toddler</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/can-your-nipple-fall-off-while-breastfeeding_uk_63d8fa1fe4b0c2b49adeae04\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/63d90f9c250000610073c690.jpeg?cache=YP8mtF6Yva\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/can-your-nipple-fall-off-while-breastfeeding_uk_63d8fa1fe4b0c2b49adeae04\">Can Your Nipple *Actually* Fall Off While Breastfeeding?

Is this concept still weird? My husband thinks so as he grew up with just his mother and much older brother.”</p><h2><strong>Is it OK to be naked in front of your kids?</strong></h2><p>In my household, privacy is limited – I can’t even take a shower without someone barging in to sing Wheels On The Bus at me. And I’m fine with that. </p><p>I’m not ashamed of my body and I don’t want my kids to grow up feeling shame around their bodies, either. I also personally think it’s great for opening conversations with little kids around what our body parts are called and what their functions are. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1kr7qte/this_might_be_a_weird_question_naked_household/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Most Redditors</a> seemed to think nudity is fine, with one caveat. It’s OK until someone – whether you or the kids – becomes uncomfortable.</p><p>“It’s nothing to be shamed, and nothing to be forced either,” said one commenter.</p><p>Another said their husband stopped being comfortable “fully nude” around their daughter when she was a toddler.</p><p>“That’s respected, but it’s also not some huge deal if she runs into the room to tell him about her made up dragons while he’s changing, he’ll cover up or turn away and ask for privacy,” they said. </p><p>“At 8 she wants privacy for the bathroom mostly, we respect that, but then she will run around the house naked or just in underwear. She sees me changing frequently and it doesn’t make either of us uncomfortable so for now that’s fine. Everyone gets to say in what level of privacy they want within the family.”</p><p>There are definitely rules that are useful to follow, though. </p><p>One parent said they have three rules in their household: “Respect anyone asking for privacy, no naked butts on the couch, and we all put on clothes for visitors.”</p><p>Another said they have conversations around what’s appropriate to do in private (versus out and about), as well as consent. </p><p>“We don’t shame nudity, we explain anatomy using anatomical language, we teach about things that are only appropriate to do in private, and who’s allowed to view/touch his private parts and who isn’t,” they said. </p><p>“Whenever our son is ready to keep his nudity private or ask us to do the same, that’s fine, we’ll change. He knows it’s up to him.”</p><p>Experts agree it can be beneficial, too. </p><p>Amy Lang, a child sexual health educator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/23/being-naked-around-your-own-kids-good-for-them-consent#:~:text=Because%20family%20nudity%20gives%20children,sex%20in%20a%20healthy%20way.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">told The Guardian that while</a> strict rules and guidelines are needed (ie. telling kids not to touch other people’s private parts), family nudity gives kids the opportunity to talk about boundaries, bodies and safety.</p></div><!-- start relEntries --><div class=\"related-entries related-entries--thumbs related-entries--recirc yr-related-entries\"><h3 class=\"related-entries__head\">Related...</h3><ul class=\"related-entries__list\"><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/is-it-ok-to-cry-in-front-of-kids_uk_682db9ffe4b0627160e7e2b3\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/682dbea11a000095006251f6.jpg?cache=18B5lQ01Dv\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/is-it-ok-to-cry-in-front-of-kids_uk_682db9ffe4b0627160e7e2b3\">Should You Ever Cry In Front Of Your Kids?

Equally, there may be some disappointed kids. </p><p>Whether they’re upset over their results, worried about what it means for their future, or just seem a bit down about something else entirely, clinical psychologist <a href=\"https://luciephd.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr Lucie Hemmen</a> has shared some helpful advice for parents. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.luciehemmen/video/7506979052956192046?_r=1&amp;_t=ZN-8yoKCMrJl9q\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">In a TikTok video</a>, the expert said the quick tip sounds “cheesy” until you experience it “and see how deeply it works”. </p><h2><strong>Advice to help someone feel better</strong></h2><p>If your teenager is unloading something, the psychologist advised really listening for the emotion they’re expressing – “there’s lots of content in there, but the thing you’re really listening for is the feeling,” she explained in her video.</p><p>Don’t interrupt as they share what’s going on. Her advice is that when they pause and take a break, “you reflect that feeling [back] to them”.</p><p>Dubbed emotional attunement, it’s basically about <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/childhood-emotional-neglect/202211/the-opposite-emotional-neglect-emotional-attunement\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">being aware of – and empathising with – another person’s feelings</a>. </p><p>Dr Hemmen explained that it works so well because when we feel heard, and felt, “you can feel your nervous system slow down”. We feel validated and, ultimately, supported – and this can be especially important for kids. </p><p>The psychologist suggested you could say something like: “Honey, you’ve got a lot going on and I really am hearing how stressed you are. I hear how much you have on your plate.”</p><p>Likewise if your teen is anxious in the lead up to finding out their results, or disappointed on the day, mirror back to them that you can see how they’re feeling.</p><p>The tip isn’t just for teenagers, either. It can work well in all manner of relationships. Plenty of commenters agreed that emotional attunement has helped them, too.</p><p>One TikTok user said: “Having your feelings validated makes you feel seen.”</p><p>Another said: “Oh, I always cry when someone validates me like this.”</p><h2><strong>Any more tips for supporting kids on results day?</strong></h2><p>Yes! Sue Alder, head of professional development and standards at the Careers Development Institute (CDI) said there are a number of ways parents can show support. These include:</p><p>1. Staying calm and positive – reassure them that results are important, but are not the only measure of success or route to their future. </p><p>2. Being prepared for different outcomes and discussing this with them ahead of time (without catastrophising). This helps reduce panic on the day.   </p><p>3. Knowing key dates and times, such as when and how results will be released, and having login details ready. This can alleviate any stress on the day. Equally, let your child be the one to take control and check their own results on the day. </p><p>4. Getting to grips with UCAS – familiarise yourself with key terms like Firm and Insurance offers, Clearing and Deferral. </p><p>5. Having plan B (and C) ready – discuss alternative routes, such as different universities via Clearing, degree apprenticeships, foundation year courses, HNCs and HNDs, or taking a gap year.<span style=\"font-size: 1.231em; background-color: initial;\"></span></p><p>6. Avoiding comparisons – don’t compare their results to siblings, friends, or anyone else. </p><p>7. Celebrating effort, not just results. No matter the grades, praise their hard work, resilience, and how far they’ve come.</p></div><!-- start relEntries --><div class=\"related-entries related-entries--thumbs related-entries--recirc yr-related-entries\"><h3 class=\"related-entries__head\">Related...</h3><ul class=\"related-entries__list\"><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/parenting-mistakes-lecturing-teens_uk_68836281e4b036c6e702de2a\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68837317190000e3e1600361.jpg?cache=dQelN83cll\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/parenting-mistakes-lecturing-teens_uk_68836281e4b036c6e702de2a\">I'm A Child Psychiatrist – Don't Make This 1 Mistake When Talking To Teens</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/porn-age-verification-check-advice-parents_uk_6881ea8de4b0d55a3f196462\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/688200de19000034876001fd.jpg\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/porn-age-verification-check-advice-parents_uk_6881ea8de4b0d55a3f196462\">UK Porn Age Verification Is Here – But What If We’re Sending Teens Somewhere Worse?</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lifetime-isa-martin-lewis-parent-advice_uk_686e2f77e4b041f69cfdc9c5\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/686e342d240000ccc409fdb7.png\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/lifetime-isa-martin-lewis-parent-advice_uk_686e2f77e4b041f69cfdc9c5\">Martin Lewis Urges Parents Of Teens To Do 1 Thing When They Turn 18</a></li></ul></div><!-- end relEntries -->",

While labour and delivery nurses are there in the room helping pregnant people endure the pain of contractions and epidurals, they are also sometimes dealing with bored, judgmental partners.</p><p>“A lot of times, you just are making eye contact with the other nurses in the room. Like, ‘Can you believe what is happening at this moment?’” said Yancy Guzmán, a North Carolina-based nurse. </p><p>“Labour is where partners rise to the occasion or fail miserably,” said North Carolina-based nurse Jen Hamilton.</p><p>“I see it all the time where people have so much hope that their person is going to just step up to the plate ... It’s just so devastating to watch somebody who you know had these really high expectations and then they weren’t met.“</p><p>And the nurses interviewed, who have seen hundreds of births, said this unsupportive behaviour is exclusive to heterosexual men.</p><p>Although they cannot predict whether couples will divorce, several of the nurses said they know when you should divorce, or hope you will. “I never know the end of people’s stories, but I feel like I can make a very educated guess on whether or not their relationship will stand the test of parenthood,” Hamilton said. </p><p>Washington-based nurse Alyssa Richard said that during labour, nurses see who men “authentically are behind whatever facade they may put up in front of people”.</p><p>Here are the biggest offences nurses say they’ve seen from men while their partner was in labour.</p><h2><strong>1. They sleep through active labour</strong></h2><p>Richard said men sleeping through their partner’s active labour is the most common unsupportive behaviour she sees that frustrates her the most.  </p><p>“If there’s an emergency, and if the baby’s heart rate drops, tons of nurses will come running in and start doing all kinds of stuff with the mom, and the dad’s just over there sleeping, or pulls the blanket over their head so they don’t have to be bothered by what’s going on – that’s my biggest pet peeve, that’s crazy,” Richard said. </p><p>Hamilton said she recently had a woman who was screaming during labour, and “this guy is trying to cover his ears to get a better snoozy position. I was so aggravated.”</p><p>Richard said that birth partners should only be sleeping when the person who is labouring is sleeping: “It’s such a short chapter in your life ... I don’t think it’s that big of an inconvenience for you to also be awake with them.” </p><p>In some cases, Richard has woken up sleeping men with, “Hey, time to be up now. We need you [to be] a part of this.” </p><h2><strong>2. They complain about <em>their</em> discomfort</strong></h2></div><div><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/689640b5170000762263dd5e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_630_noupscale\" />\"Labour is where partners rise to the occasion or fail miserably,\" said North Carolina-based nurse Jen Hamilton.</div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p>While their partner is going through the ordeal of birthing a whole human, some men will make this day about them, nurses said. </p><p>Hamilton said that when a man’s first instinct is to worry about his own comfort in the room rather than his labouring partner’s – with comments like “How do you work the TV?” or “I need more pillows” – it raises a red flag for her.</p><p>“Just a couple weeks ago, I had a dad make a comment about how this was really inconvenient for him because he had been working all day,” Richard said. “And I’m just like, ‘What the heck?’ I can’t even imagine saying that to someone, let alone your partner that you’re supposed to be having a baby with.”</p><h2><strong>3. They play video games</strong></h2><p>There are some men who <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/manchild-according-to-men_l_6880f2b9e4b0a3d10a1fbbf3\">prioritise watching a screen over being there</a> for their partner. “I’ve seen them with headsets on so they’re fully involved in an online game, while there’s just like chaos going on around them,” Richard said. </p><p>“I’ve seen a guy go to Best Buy while his wife or girlfriend is in labour and get a 55-inch screen monitor and bring it to the hospital because their gaming system wouldn’t hook up to our TVs,” Hamilton said. </p><p>Richard said it’s fine to play games if your partner is comfortable or resting, but “when your partner’s awake crying ... playing your video games isn’t inappropriate”.</p><h2><strong>4. They leave when it matters most</strong></h2></div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p>“I had a guy one time who had signed up for a timeshare talk, and literally left his wife when she was eight centimetres dilated to go to a timeshare talk and missed the birth of his child,” Hamilton said. </p><p>Guzmán recalled a time when a dad never acknowledged the nurses in the room. “He moved his recliner so that he was facing the TV and never had to look in our direction ... and then he kind of got up abruptly. He’s like, ‘I’ve just been stuck in this room this whole day, and I just need to walk outside,’” she said.</p><p>“Meanwhile, his partner’s in the bed, who literally can’t leave the room, who’s the one doing all the hard things, and he’s turning it into this situation where it’s about him.”</p><h2><strong>5. They make inappropriate comments about their partner’s body</strong></h2><p>After childbirth, stitches might be needed for vaginal repairs. On more than one occasion, Richard said, she has heard men making “incredibly inappropriate comments about sewing it up tighter or ‘Is it going to look as good as it did before?’”.</p><h2><strong>6. They judge their partner’s decisions during childbirth</strong></h2><p>Hamilton said it’s unsupportive when men insert their own judgments about the labouring patient’s choices with comments such as, “You don’t need an epidural” or “You’re being a wimp.”</p><p>“I am going to support whatever she wants, but he’s making it so much harder for her to get relief,” Hamilton said. “He’s making it so much harder for her to feel at peace in her decision.”</p><p>Guzmán said when men make judgments about what their partner should do for pain management, “I will try to get the dad out of the room by saying, ‘Can you go get me some ice water for her or whatever?’ And then I do take advantage of that time to say, like, ‘What do you want? Why is he speaking for you?’”</p><p>Hamilton said that sometimes men will override the labouring patient’s decisions about who she wants in the room, recalling partners who wanted to bring someone like the mother-in-law into the room. “That indicates a lack of respect for her boundaries and not protecting that sacred space where she needs to feel the safest,” she said. </p><h2><strong>How can you be a better birth partner? </strong></h2><p>Fortunately, supportive birth partners outweigh the disengaged and outright hostile birth partners, nurses said. But often, there are also confused, nervous partners who could simply be better with more guidance. </p><p>Ideally, Richard said, birth partners should ask their pregnant partner, “What do you think would be helpful if you were in a lot of pain?” before the day their child is born. Some people might prefer to be touched and held, while others would not, and it’s better to talk this out before the high-stakes, stressful situation of labour. </p><p>And when it’s time to give birth, be humble about what you don’t know if you’re trying to be a support person. “A lot of nurses would really admire someone to say, I don’t know what to do, but I want to be helpful,” Guzmán said. </p><p>And if you are pregnant and concerned your baby’s father will make labour a nightmare, Hamilton encourages you to bring someone else, even if that person makes zero sense to outsiders — like a sibling, a best friend or your hairdresser who is always there for you in a crisis. </p><p>“It’s OK to pick someone that others may see as random,” Hamilton said. “Protect your peace. Labour is too hard to bring someone with you who is just going to make it harder.”</p></div><!-- start relEntries --><div class=\"related-entries related-entries--thumbs related-entries--recirc yr-related-entries\"><h3 class=\"related-entries__head\">Related...</h3><ul class=\"related-entries__list\"><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/calvin-harris-placenta-photos-vick-hope_uk_6891b547e4b0eacd23de7689\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6891bba5170000a953747e86.jpeg?cache=GmMIVTxanO\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/calvin-harris-placenta-photos-vick-hope_uk_6891b547e4b0eacd23de7689\">'You Cooked Up Placenta Like A Steak?!': Calvin Harris Shares Placenta Photos After Son's Birth</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/big-baby-trial-birth-plan-options_uk_681a65a4e4b035302f2490cc\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/681b0bba1500001c008b033d.jpg\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/big-baby-trial-birth-plan-options_uk_681a65a4e4b035302f2490cc\">A ‘Big Baby Trial’ Found 1 Way To Help Women Birth Larger Babies Safely</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/should-kids-share-birthday_uk_68398454e4b03a503eaa8858\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68398b901900001a00869655.jpg\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/should-kids-share-birthday_uk_68398454e4b03a503eaa8858\">'I Told My Husband He Ruined Our Kid's Birthday.

Nor do I want to stand over my stove for more than 10 minutes. </p><p>In times like these, I love something like <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/deli-level-pasta-salad-at-home_uk_67bd9e45e4b0f4e8df29f14a\">a dense bean salad</a> – a hearty, filling recipe that lasts for days and can simply be piled up on your plate from the fridge.</p><p>So, I recently tried a variation of the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMz4LQMteNb/?igsh=dHN1bjJyeWcwOTNn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spanish papas aliñás salad</a>. It’ll be my dinner tonight for the third day in a row (I don’t recommend keeping it longer).</p><p>To be completely honest with you, I think I’ll just make a fresh batch once that’s done – so addictive and easy-to-make is the dish. </p><h2><strong>What is papas aliñás?</strong></h2><p>Also called patatas aliñadas, it’s a Spanish potato salad usually made with potatoes, sherry vinegar, parsley, onions, hard-boiled eggs, salt, and olive oil. </p><p>The humble recipe changes from region to region – Spanish cooking expert <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/feeds/v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Guillermo Varela explained on Instagram,</a> “in the south it is more common to find this tapa with melva instead (a fish from the family of tunas but smaller and with a slightly different texture)”.</p><p>But the <a href=\"https://spanishsabores.com/patatas-alinadas-recipe-spanish-potato-salad/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">steps remain roughly the same</a>: combine boiled eggs and boiled potatoes with the onions, parsley, oil, and tart vinegar together while the spuds are still warm and then eat it once chilled. </p><p>I found the recipe to be incredibly easy but was a little worried the undeniably pungent ingredients would become overpowering. </p><p>Nope – I couldn’t believe the fresh flavour (a bit like a deconstructed and cold fishcake with added zing). I could instantly see why <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/feeds/v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Valera called the</a> “classic” salad “one of the best things to enjoy with a cold beer during the intense Spanish summer”.</p><p>The fact that prep involved nothing but an airtight container and a spoon for the three days I’ve been eating it is a definite bonus.</p></div><div><img alt=\"Papas aliñás\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/689c8d0418000006a28c552a.jpg?cache=iZgzRGgNMd&amp;ops=scalefit_630_noupscale\" />Papas aliñás</div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><h2><strong>What’s the recipe for papas aliñás?</strong></h2><p>Some <a href=\"https://spanishsabores.com/patatas-alinadas-recipe-spanish-potato-salad/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recipes use waxy new potatoes</a>, while others <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMz4LQMteNb/?igsh=dHN1bjJyeWcwOTNn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">seem to use bigger, flourier</a> kinds (I went with roosters).</p><p>Valera <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMz4LQMteNb/?igsh=dHN1bjJyeWcwOTNn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recommends either red onions or spring onions</a>, while Spanish cooking site <a href=\"https://spanishsabores.com/patatas-alinadas-recipe-spanish-potato-salad/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spanish Sabores opts</a> for white onions.</p><p>All of which is to say that, like the potato salad non-Spanish people might be used to making at home, there are no set-in-stone rules; only a general approach. </p><p>And as Spanish Sabores points out, the recipe was devised in coastal Cádiz, home to some of the <a href=\"https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/features/ingredient-focus-wild-almadraba-bluefin-tuna\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">world’s best tuna</a>. So, however you make it, try to “use very high-quality ingredients”. </p><p>With that said, the recipe I used to last me three days (which could therefore feed three people) was: </p><h3><strong>Ingredients </strong></h3><ul><li>150g (one can) tinned tuna </li><li>600g potatoes (preferably waxier or medium waxy kinds) </li><li>4 spring onions, finely chopped (use a small red or white onion if you like)</li><li>3 hard-boiled eggs</li><li>An entire bunch of parsley</li><li>30ml sherry vinegar </li><li>Olive oil (to taste)</li><li>Salt (to taste)</li></ul><h3><strong>Method </strong></h3><ul><li>Boil the potatoes in their skins starting from cold, salted water. Once the water starts to boil, check on them every five minutes; once they’re fork-tender, drain them and leave them to steam off in a colander.</li><li>While your potatoes are boiling, bring a pan of water to the boil and then add the eggs. Boil for eight minutes, then plunge the eggs in cold water. Leave for about five minutes before peeling.</li><li>Finely chop your onion and parsley. </li><li>Once your potatoes are cool enough to handle (at least 15 minutes), peel their skins and chop them into a large bowl. It helps if these are still a little warm, as that helps them to absorb more of the seasoning and dressing.</li><li>Add the parsley, onions, olive oil, sherry vinegar, tuna, sliced hard-boiled eggs, and olive oil (be generous with this). Salt to taste; add more vinegar and oil if needed.</li><li>Chill before eating. Eat within three days, and store in an airtight container in the fridge.</li></ul></div><!-- start relEntries --><div class=\"related-entries related-entries--thumbs related-entries--recirc yr-related-entries\"><h3 class=\"related-entries__head\">Related...</h3><ul class=\"related-entries__list\"><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/wfh-lunch-idea-spanish-blt-recipe_uk_6880de22e4b0c758f73c3cbc\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6880e2eb1900001a416000d5.jpeg?cache=o146q2fyTU\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/wfh-lunch-idea-spanish-blt-recipe_uk_6880de22e4b0c758f73c3cbc\">This 'Spanish BLT' Recipe Is About To Become Your Favourite Summer Lunch</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/swamp-potato-recipe_uk_6870c58fe4b00de383c095f2\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6870cc1128000058b2c6cf2c.jpg\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/swamp-potato-recipe_uk_6870c58fe4b00de383c095f2\">'Swamp Potatoes' Have Gone Viral, And It's The Easiest Slow Cooker Recipe I've Seen</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/best-pavlova-recipe_uk_681b2a8de4b0c2b15d96e3fe\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/681b3a5d1500001c008b037b.jpeg?cache=NOfV357haY\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/best-pavlova-recipe_uk_681b2a8de4b0c2b15d96e3fe\">I've Tried Over 20 Pavlova Recipes – This Is The Only One That Works Every Time</a></li></ul></div><!-- end relEntries -->",

It rattles along pleasingly enough, and Kelly is magnetic in the lead role, which just about keeps things on the rails. The plot doesn’t make sense, but as lazy Tuesday night viewing, it fits the bill.”</span></p><h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tv/article-14995117/CHRISTOPHER-STEVENS-reviews-Flight-Ch4.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Mail</a> (3/5)</strong></h2><p>“For the first half-hour, Katherine Kelly battled to maintain the pace, but like a runner who starts a marathon with a sprint, she inevitably began to flag.

Although Netflix would definitely have thrown some more money at it – the production values are a bit cheap and dreary. For a series set in various international locations, you never get the sense that it’s being filmed anywhere other than a cold European country. Kelly is great in the lead role, playing an ordinary person caught in an extraordinary situation.”</span></p></div><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\"><div style=\"padding: 16px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMr5cQIIv5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"line-height: 0; padding: 0 0; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; width: 100%;\" target=\"_blank\"><div style=\"display: flex;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;\"></div><div style=\"display: flex;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 60px;\"></div></div></div><div style=\"padding: 19% 0;\"></div><div style=\"display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;\"></div><div style=\"padding-top: 8px;\"><div style=\"color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;\">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style=\"padding: 12.5% 0;\"></div><div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 14px;\"><div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: 8px;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 20px; width: 20px;\"></div><div></div></div><div style=\"margin-left: auto;\"><div></div><div></div><div></div></div></div><div style=\"display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;\"><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;\"></div><div style=\"background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; height: 14px; width: 144px;\"></div></div></a><p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; white-space: nowrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMr5cQIIv5f/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Channel 4 (@channel4)</a></p></div></blockquote><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/drama/in-flight-katherine-kelly-misstep-comment/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Radio Times</a></strong></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Kelly should be praised for the outstanding work she does here, and there are no doubt elements to enjoy.

Cracks, dents, oil leaks, and other damage are often darker than the white paint, making them easier to detect and address quickly, helping boost maintenance efficiency and keep passengers safer,” Parker stated. </p><h2><strong>Any other reasons?</strong></h2><p>Yup. Cold, hard cash. </p><p>“Aircraft paints are specialised and expensive, requiring large volumes up to 3,600 litres of paint for a jumbo jet like the Airbus A380. Because white is the most commonly used colour, it is also the least expensive and lightest paint option,” Parker shared.</p><p>“Using lighter paint reduces aircraft weight, which lowers fuel consumption and operating costs.” </p><p>On top of that, white paint <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/feeds/v\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fades less than coloured</a> ones. And seeing as “repainting grounds the aircraft for up to two weeks and can cost between £150,000 to £300,000, airlines prefer white paint because it maintains its look for longer and saves money”.</p><p>Not since Miranda Priestly’s <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/news/the-devil-wears-prada/\">The Devil Wears Prada</a> speech about cerulean have I realised the importance of a simple colour...</p></div><!-- start relEntries --><div class=\"related-entries related-entries--thumbs related-entries--recirc yr-related-entries\"><h3 class=\"related-entries__head\">Related...</h3><ul class=\"related-entries__list\"><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/this-is-the-real-reason-you-cant-go-back-on-the-plane-if-you-left-something-behind_uk_6895d0a9e4b03259770b0b1d\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68922f8318000032018c4c63.jpeg\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/this-is-the-real-reason-you-cant-go-back-on-the-plane-if-you-left-something-behind_uk_6895d0a9e4b03259770b0b1d\">This Is The Real Reason You Can't Go Back On The Plane If You Left Something Behind</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/how-to-stop-ears-popping-plane_uk_681cc397e4b0ef0ad6120f6d\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/681cc98b1900001a00175d1f.jpg\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/how-to-stop-ears-popping-plane_uk_681cc397e4b0ef0ad6120f6d\">I'm A Pilot – Here's How To Actually Stop Your Ears Popping On A Plane</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/suitcase-colour-unloading-time_uk_67bdd7c4e4b0659288fe03bd\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/67bde2a714000024000bd15d.jpg\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/suitcase-colour-unloading-time_uk_67bdd7c4e4b0659288fe03bd\">I Asked Flight Experts Which Suitcase Colour They'd Never Use, And I'm Surprised</a></li></ul></div><!-- end relEntries -->",

How many sexual offences were recorded in this country in 2015? I’ll give you a guess. 103,614 in one year. Almost 35,000 reports of rapes, 68,000 reports of other sexual offences.</p><p>“This is the country that Nigel Farage thinks was a safe haven for women and girls. He wasn’t talking about it back then, was he? He wasn’t banging this drum passionately in defence of women and girls and their safety back then.</p><p>“But as soon as it’s asylum seekers ‘oh it’s outrageous, we’re not a safe haven any more’. We never were, Nigel. You just didn’t seem to take  much notice of it when the perpetrators were white.

“Trump’s approach is not about what America can get out of the talks, but about what Trump can get out of them.”</p><p>Pack continued: “Just as the tariffs were not meant to strength the US economy (but rather to increase Presidential leverage over the private sector) and Trump backed away from enforcing them when they threatened <a href=\"https://natoandtheged.substack.com/p/can-the-bond-market-save-humanity\">‘his beautiful bond market’</a>, Trump’s negotiations with Putin in Alaska are not intended to secure American interests in Eastern Europe, but rather to create a neo-imperial photo op.”</p><p>If Pack’s assessment is true, this will likely play well with Putin.</p><p>Few believe he wants to end the war, especially as he is actually <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/uk-putins-army-still-taking-large-chunks-of-ukraines-land_uk_6898495fe4b0f3b8e58d7338\">still succeeding on the battlefield</a> and continually taking more of Ukraine’s land.</p><p>Grace Mappes, Russia analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said Putin is not interested in peace.</p><p>She told HuffPost UK: “Putin hasn’t indicated he’s actually willing to cede occupied territory or relinquish any of his territorial demands, which is at odds with Trump’s reported aim of returning occupied southern Ukraine to Ukrainian control.</p><p>“Putin reiterated earlier in August his commitment to his war goals, including his demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from all of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhia oblasts.</p><p>“Putin’s demand that Ukraine cede all of Donbas before agreeing to a ceasefire is disguised as a compromise but is actually a way for his military to gain territory it would otherwise take years to seize while staving off US sanctions and not make actual concessions for peace.”</p><p>Similarly, Lord Darroch, the former British ambassador to the US, told Times Radio, little is expected to come out of Friday’s meeting.</p><p>“The safest prediction to make is that not very much will come out of it,” he said.</p><p>“The Russians are briefing in Moscow that this is basically a meeting about improving Russian-American bilateral relations, which shows their focus is not really about Ukraine,” he said, noting that the US is still claiming its all about Ukraine.</p><p>“The two parties are way too far apart on any of the issues that need to be settled,” Darroch said.</p><p>The ex-ambassador said there may be a form of temporary ceasefire and the launch of some future negotiations.</p><p>For anything more effective, he claimed there is usually a long process leading up to meetings between leaders where points of agreement and potential disagreements are identified.</p><p>He explained that he believed this face-to-face was arranged with little notice and the prospect of Ukraine peace is too difficult to deal with in one meeting.</p><p>“That is Donald Trump for you,” the former diplomat said. “He genuinely believes that it’s him face to face with Putin, that’s going to be the answer.”</p></div><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">“That is Donald Trump for you…He genuinely believes that it’s him face to face with Putin, that’s going to be the answer.”<br /><br />Lord Darroch, former British ambassador to the US, tells <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SebastianEPayne?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SebastianEPayne</a> he suspects “not very much” will come of Trump’s meeting with Putin. <a href=\"https://t.co/At8tXkrO3u\">pic.twitter.com/At8tXkrO3u</a></p>&mdash;

Trump was friends with Maxwell for even longer through her father, Robert Maxwell, the British publishing magnate who in 1991 bought the New York Daily News.</p><p>When Maxwell was charged in 2020, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/nyregion/trump-ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein.html\">said</a>: “I just wish her well.”</p><p>Of late, Trump has swung between avoiding queries about Epstein and Maxwell — he claimed he <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-epstein-seven-years_n_68925b49e4b044af87ac7173\">did not understand the question</a> when a reporter asked why it took him seven years to end Epstein’s membership at his Palm Beach country club, Mar-a-Lago — and claiming that his involvement with the two was minimal.</p><p>“I never had the privilege of going to his island, and I did turn it down,” the president said last month about Epstein’s infamous Little St. James in the US Virgin Islands.</p><p>Although Trump and his allies promised during his 2024 campaign to release investigative files on Epstein, he is now claiming that doing so could hurt the reputations of innocent people. </p><p>Trump’s own name appears in the files, according to published reports, which Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/us/politics/trump-epstein-files-named.html\">explained </a>to him during a briefing.</p><p>On July 7, Bondi’s Department of Justice issued a statement that no further information would be released about Epstein’s case — even though in February, Bondi herself staged a photo opportunity boasting about the release of “Epstein Files” binders to pro-Trump media influencers.</p><p>Following angry backlash from Trump’s supporters, Bondi requested that a federal judge release the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings that produced the indictment against Maxwell. On Monday, US District Judge Paul Engelmayer denied that request, <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.539611/gov.uscourts.nysd.539611.809.0.pdf\">writing </a>that it appeared to be an effort to obfuscate rather than illuminate.</p><p>“A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the government’s motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency’ but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” he wrote.</p></div>",

Or how would you feel if that happened to you?</p><p>“Talking about what kids see on screen can help them reflect, process, and build the skills they need to cope, adapt and grow,” he added.</p></div><!-- start relEntries --><div class=\"related-entries related-entries--thumbs related-entries--recirc yr-related-entries\"><h3 class=\"related-entries__head\">Related...</h3><ul class=\"related-entries__list\"><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/why-the-1-bluey-episode-has-sent-so-many-parents-over-the-edge_uk_661d00e7e4b0bdba1c5a6173\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/661e34f52300006a1a0d3214.jpeg\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/why-the-1-bluey-episode-has-sent-so-many-parents-over-the-edge_uk_661d00e7e4b0bdba1c5a6173\">Why This 1 Bluey Episode Has Sent So Many Parents Over The Edge</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/bluey-is-the-comfort-show-i-didnt-know-i-needed-as-an-adult_uk_65f18d25e4b02ad7de1b139b\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/65e777482300001f00656696.jpeg?cache=3ZG2UZOlVO\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/bluey-is-the-comfort-show-i-didnt-know-i-needed-as-an-adult_uk_65f18d25e4b02ad7de1b139b\">'Bluey' Is The Comfort Show I Didn't Know I Needed As An Adult</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dads-reaction-to-watching-bluey-has-parents-everywhere-nodding-their-heads_uk_656f2eede4b0dcfcc9818115\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/656f35d4230000c971ea6e00.png\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/dads-reaction-to-watching-bluey-has-parents-everywhere-nodding-their-heads_uk_656f2eede4b0dcfcc9818115\">Dad Nails Every Parent's Reaction To Watching Bluey For The First Time</a></li></ul></div><!-- end relEntries -->",

I do think it’s too old now and your eldest needs to start having some privacy,” said one respondent.</p><p>Another said: “I’d be enforcing separate bath times. I’d do it in a gentle way rather than make them feel they were wrong for it but they do need to know that bathing together isn’t appropriate.”</p><p>But there were also many commenters who didn’t see any issue. “Personally I think as long as they are happy, it is fine,” said one respondent.</p><p>“In the UK we are quite conservative about nudity, which influences people’s views. It would seem odd if you prevented then having a bath together when they are used to it. I imagine your eldest will decide to stop soon enough without your interference.”</p><p>Another said: “I imagine your elder son will decide soon enough that he doesn’t want to share anymore. I think if the boys are both happy with it then it’s fine.”</p><h2><strong>Is there an age when siblings should stop bathing together?</strong></h2><h3><strong>First up, consider safety</strong></h3><p>There is no strict clinical or legal age when children should start bathing independently, Dr Patapia Tzotzoli, clinical psychologist and founder of <a href=\"http://mytriagenetwork.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">My Triage Network,</a> told HuffPost UK.</p><p>“Readiness depends more on maturity, motor skills, and safety awareness than age, and parents should adjust for each child’s needs,” she explained.</p><p>In the UK, safety guidance states <a href=\"https://www.johnsonsbaby.co.uk/bath/toddler-bath-time\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">children under the age of five</a> must never be left alone in the bath. Yet “between about five and eight years, parents need to stay nearby for supervision”, warned Dr Tzotzoli.</p><p>You can be gradually handing over tasks, such as teaching them how to properly wash themselves and wash their hair, during this time. </p><p>“The goal is to build autonomy and competence over time. Parents can start by framing bath time as their private time, important for relaxation and self-care. They should talk about privacy and use correct anatomical terms when discussing private parts with their children,” said Dr Tzotzoli.</p><p>“By around 8-10 years, many children can manage the full routine independently with an adult nearby and periodically checking on them,” the psychologist said. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4606916/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">survey found the average age that adults</a> believed a child could bathe alone was 7.5 years old. </p><p>Former sex education teacher <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thekathleenhema/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kathleen Hema </a>suggests parents can start offering separate baths once safety isn’t a concern. “This age can be different for each child and when parents feel there is no safety risk,” she explained.</p><h3 dir=\"auto\"><strong>See how your kids feel about it</strong></h3><div dir=\"auto\">Once they’ve reached an age where safety is less of an issue, it’s worth telling your children they can bathe separately if they want – perhaps to gauge how they would feel about it, and whether they would want to. </div><div dir=\"auto\">“There’s nothing inherently wrong with siblings bathing together. Nor is there anything wrong with siblings bathing separately,” Hema told HuffPost UK.</div><div dir=\"auto\">“If the kids aren’t respecting each other during bath time (not respecting boundaries), then there is a reason to end it. Or if one kid says they want to bathe separately, then there is a reason to end it.”</div><div dir=\"auto\">It’s important to set boundaries from a young age around not touching other people’s genitals – including siblings. </div><div dir=\"auto\">“Ensuring safety and comfort for all siblings is the parent’s job,” Hema continued. “Parents can check in with their kids by reminding them they can shower separately whenever they want.</div><div dir=\"auto\">“They can also discuss privacy and what that means to them and let their kids know that they can request privacy at any time.”</div><div dir=\"auto\">Erica Miller, clinical psychologist and director at <a href=\"https://www.connectedmindsnyc.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Connected Minds NYC,</a> previously told <a href=\"https://www.scarymommy.com/parenting/when-should-kids-stop-bathing-together\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Scary Mommy</a> in her experience, children “begin to express more of a desire for privacy around 10 years old”.</div><div dir=\"auto\">Although she noted “this may come earlier for girls than boys who often begin puberty earlier”.</div><div dir=\"auto\">Ultimately, the time when siblings might no longer want to have a bath together can depend on a range of things – a child’s comfort levels, maturation, desire for more privacy, or simply wanting more space (it can be a tight squeeze in the tub as kids get bigger!).</div><p>If a child decides they no longer want to bathe with siblings, the important thing for us to do as parents is respect that wish. </p></div><!-- start relEntries --><div class=\"related-entries related-entries--thumbs related-entries--recirc yr-related-entries\"><h3 class=\"related-entries__head\">Related...</h3><ul class=\"related-entries__list\"><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/how-often-should-we-bath-babies-toddlers-kids_uk_67ae31ebe4b0d5971dbda454\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/67ae38fe1600001800637745.png\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/how-often-should-we-bath-babies-toddlers-kids_uk_67ae31ebe4b0d5971dbda454\">Here's How Often Kids Should Bathe, And Why It’s About More Than Just The Smell</a></li><li class=\"related-entries__list__item yr-related-entry\"><a class=\"related-entries__image\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/pacing-parenting-tip-slow-down_uk_6893037de4b044af87acba39\"><img class=\"related-entries__image__src\" src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/68930da31800003f3a8c4d48.jpeg\" /></a><a class=\"related-entries__title entry__link--omit yr-card-headline\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/pacing-parenting-tip-slow-down_uk_6893037de4b044af87acba39\">What Is Pacing?

Only the Conservatives will stop the crossings and restore control of Britain’s borders.”</p><p>The number of small boat crossings are a major source of embarrassment for Labour, which pledged during last year’s general election to “smash the people-smuggling gangs” responsible.</p><p>And even government minister Jacqui Smith, who served as the home secretary under <a

rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Breakfast</a> this morning that number pf crossings under Labour was “unacceptable”.</p><p>But independent migration policy researcher Zoe Gardner, told HuffPost UK the government is focusing on the wrong issue.</p><p>She said Labour should instead increase the number of legal immigration routes to the UK, thereby taking away the need for asylum seekers to risk their lives in the English Channel.</p><p>She said: “50,000 people since Labour came to power corresponds to about 5 or 6% of all immigration during that period.</p><p>“If it wasn’t

asylum in the UK.</p><p>And, as human rights organisation <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/resources/truth-about-safe-and-legal-routes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amnesty International explained</a>, a “safe and legal route” means a journey formally approved by the government.</p><p>But, “the government allows nobody to make a claim for asylum in the UK unless they are physically present in the UK” and “it is impossible to come to the UK for the purpose of seeking asylum in any way permitted by the government’s immigration rules”.</p><p>The only exceptions apply to people from Ukraine and someone who has family in the UK or has a partner or child who has been granted asylum in Britain.</p><p>There is also a visa route for some Afghans who have worked for the government.</p><p>As Amnesty International noted on its website: “Seeking asylum from persecution is lawful – refugees don’t need anyone’s permission to do so.”</p><p>It concluded: “It is <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/resources/governments-queue-less-policy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">a government choice</a> to require refugees wishing to seek asylum in the UK to rely on dangerous journeys and people smugglers.”</p><p>The government is desperate to bring the number of small boat crossings down and prove to voters it is dealing with the migration
