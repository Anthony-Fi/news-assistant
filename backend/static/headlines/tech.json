      "summary": "<p>The Supreme Court has decided not to weigh in on one of the many state-level age-verification laws currently being reviewed across the country. Today, the top court chose not to intervene on legislation from Mississippi about checking the ages of social media users, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a97_5h25.pdf\"><ins>denying</ins></a> an application to vacate stay from NetChoice.</p>\n<p>The Mississippi law requires all users to verify their ages in order to use social media sites. It also places responsibility on the social networks to prevent children from accessing &quot;harmful materials&quot; and it requires parental consent for minors to use any social media. NetChoice represents several tech companies — including social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube — and it sued to block the law on grounds that it violates the First Amendment. A district court ruled in favor of NetChoice, but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals lifted its temporary block.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Although Justice Brett Kavanaugh denied the application to vacate stay on the appeals court ruling, he also wrote that &quot;NetChoice has, in my view, demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits—namely, that enforcement of the Mississippi law would likely violate its members' First Amendment rights under this Court’s precedents.&quot; He denied the application because NetChoice &quot;has not sufficiently demonstrated that the balance of harms and equities favors it at this time.&quot; This decision means that, at least for now, Mississippi's law will be allowed to stand.</p>\n<p>&quot;Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment,&quot; <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://netchoice.org/netchoice-confident-the-first-amendment-will-prevail-against-mississippis-i-d-for-speech-law/\">said</a> Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center. &quot;This is merely an unfortunate procedural delay.&quot;</p>\n<p>There are several other state laws being assessed at various points in the US legal system.

We'll update this article if we hear back.</p>\n<p>Valve says it want to offer PayPal payments in those unsupported currencies in the future, &quot;but the timeline is uncertain.&quot; What does seem clear, based on Valve's deliberate association, is that this PayPal issue is part of the ongoing censorship battle being waged on Steam and <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/itchio-is-removing-nsfw-games-to-comply-with-payment-processors-rules-133045491.html\">Itch.io</a>.</p>\n<p>Multiple games were <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/steam-now-bans-games-that-violate-the-rules-and-standards-of-payment-processors-and-banks-164222173.html\">delisted from Steam in July</a> because they failed to meet new guidelines that require games abide by the standards and policies of payment processors. Because certain NSFW games didn't, they were removed. Valve later <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393\">told <em>Kotaku</em></a> that Mastercard essentially forced it to remove those games by threatening it through payment processor intermediaries. And Mastercard was reportedly pressured to do so in the first place by conservative activists who took issue with certain sexually explicit games on Steam.</p>\n<p>In this case, a bank that works with PayPal is the weak link, rather than Steam or a payment network, but it's entirely possible that acquiring bank is responding to a similar kind of pressure.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/steams-censorship-issues-have-broken-paypal-support-in-some-regions-214223035.html?src=rss",

The game tasks players with rhythmically controlling cute little soldiers called Cobuns, but directing these warriors while avoiding damage is easier said than done. We said it felt like &quot;the gaming equivalent of patting your head and rubbing your stomach.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"47c19bce08c64b17a013d98fee6c3afd\"></div>\n<p>The developer also announced some new features coming to the game. It revealed two new worlds, including a jungle and a garden that's been frozen over, along with new soldier and weapon types. This is 2025, so the game also features a roguelike element, as players can encounter unique power-ups and buffs during each run.</p>\n<p>There's still a lot we don't know about this title, including the price and when it'll eventually come to gaming consoles. The developer has a livestream planned for September 14 hosted by voice actor Tomokazu Sugita. The stream &quot;will feature the latest updates, our post-launch roadmap and information on upcoming events.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>Patapon</em> originally came out all the way back in 2007 for the PSP. It was followed by a handful of sequels, all originally for Sony's first portable console. The first two games have been ported to other consoles, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/patapon-1--2-replay-brings-two-psp-classics-to-pc-ps5-and-switch-on-july-11-143627055.html\"><ins>including the Switch and PS5</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/ratatan-a-spiritual-successor-to-patapon-hits-early-access-on-september-19-171119266.html?src=rss",

The key to this is a new case featuring what the company is calling the industry's first patented Cryo Chamber, which puts the PC's liquid-cooled radiator in a separate compartment to prevent hot air from spreading and impacting the rest of the system's thermals. With this arrangement, HP says it was able to reduce temperatures by up to 7.5 degrees Celsius at full load. Meanwhile, thanks to smaller touches like raised feet, vented PCI slots and open vents on the bottom of the case, HP was able to improve GPU temps by another two degrees C.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>But to me, the best thing about the Omen Max 45L is that HP says it's using industry-standard components across the board instead of proprietary parts and fittings like we sometimes see in pre-built systems from major vendors. This means that down the line, if you want to replace or upgrade a specific component, you'll be able to do just that instead of potentially needing to replace the entire computer. And if that isn't enough, the Omen comes with a CPU cooler that has a small built-in display that you can load up with practically any image or short video clip.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the desktop comes with a fully modular power supply (with up to 1,200 watts), which is a first for the Omen line. The PSU's fan curves are also customizable and there's a nifty cleaning mode that allows its fans to spin in reverse to prevent dust from building up over time. Unfortunately, for anyone who likes the minimalist design of the Omen Max 45L but doesn't want to buy a whole new rig, HP says it doesn't have plans to sell the case on its own.</p>\n<p>Naturally, as the beefiest desktop in HP's gaming desktop family, the Omen Max 45L can be configured with top-of-the-line components including up to an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D processor, an NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU, 128GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of PCIe Gen5 storage.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 is HP's latest top-tier wireless gaming headset.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/888c67b0-7921-11f0-b39f-f6ea965d9639\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Aside from the Omen Max 45L, HP also has a bunch of refreshed PC gaming peripherals on the way, headlined by the $300 HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 wireless headset. Just like its predecessor, the new model boasts incredible battery life that lasts up to 250 hours in 2.4GHz mode, 53mm drivers and support for dual audio inputs via Bluetooth. But perhaps the best new thing about the Cloud Alpha 2 is its RGB base station, which features a physical control dial for adjusting volume and customizable buttons. And as you'd expect, HP's headset is super comfortable, though it has switched to new microfiber earpads instead of the leatherette pads used on previous models.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, for anyone on a tighter budget there are also two versions of the new HyperX Cloud Flight 2 wireless headset ($130 for the PC/PlayStation version or $140 for the Xbox variant) that come with RGB lighting and removable side panels for extra personalization.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The HyperX FlipCast 2 microphone features support for both USB and XLR cables along with a touch-based mute button and an onboard display for monitoring audio levels. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/cd2549a0-7921-11f0-a9f7-d811e16048dd\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>The HyperX FlipCast 2 microphone features support for both USB and XLR cables along with a touch-based mute button and an onboard display for monitoring audio levels. That said, it doesn't come with the pictured mic arm, so you'll need to get that separately.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Finally, for folks in the market for a new desktop mic, HP has two offerings there as well: the $230 HyperX FlipCast and the $60 SoloCast 2. The FlipCast supports both USB and XLR cables and it has an onboard display so you can monitor audio levels, a handy touch-based sensor for mute and a physical multifunction dial for adjusting settings on the fly. Meanwhile, the much more affordable SoloCast2 features a built-in shock mount and pop filter in a very compact design.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"For just $60, the HyperX SoloCast 2 microphone offers a built-in shock mount and pop filter in a compact design. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/ac6fdfe0-7921-11f0-9ae3-c47d3ed66d1a\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Sadly, the Omen Max 45L  and the HyperX CloudX Flight 2 headset won't be available until the end of the year in December. But everything else will be available sooner with the HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 and the FlipCast 2 and SoloCast 2 mics arriving sometime this month, followed by the Cloud Flight 2 wireless headset for PC and PlayStation in October.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-omen-max-45l-is-the-star-of-hps-latest-pc-gaming-update-170052753.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "<p>This past spring, Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-new-learning-mode-will-prompt-students-to-answer-questions-on-their-own-172057828.html\">introduced learning mode</a>, a feature that changed Claude's interaction style. When enabled, the chatbot would, following a question, try to guide the user to their own solution, instead of providing them with an answer outright. Since its introduction in April, learning mode has only been available to Claude for Education users. Now, like OpenAI did with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpts-study-mode-will-guide-students-to-an-answer-stey-by-step-180614172.html\">Study Mode</a>, Anthropic is making the tool available to everyone.</p>\n<p>Starting today, <a href=\"http://claude.ai/\">Claude.ai</a> users will find a new option within the style dropdown menu titled &quot;Learning.&quot; The experience here is similar to the one Anthropic offers with <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/introducing-claude-for-education\">Claude for Education</a>. When you turn learning mode on, the chatbot will employ a Socratic approach, trying to guide you through your question. However, unlike the real-life Socrates, who was famous for bombarding strangers with endless questions, you can turn off learning mode at any time.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Notably, Anthropic is also offering two different takes on the feature through <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\">Claude Code</a>. First, there's an &quot;Explanatory&quot; mode where Claude will generate summaries of its decision-making process as it works, giving the user a chance to better understand what it's doing.</p>\n<p>For those at the start of their coding career or hobby, there's also a more robust option, which is once again called &quot;Learning.&quot; Here, Claude will occasionally stop what it's doing and mark a section with a &quot;#TODO&quot; comment to prompt the user to write five to 10 lines of their code. If you want to try the two features out for yourself, update to the latest version of Claude Code and type &quot;/output-styles.&quot; You can then select between the two modes or Claude's default behavior.</p>\n<p>According to Drew Bent, education lead at Anthropic, learning mode, particularly as it exists in Claude Code, is the company's attempt to make its chatbot into more of a collaborative tool. &quot;I think it's great that there's a race between all of the AI labs to offer the best learning mode,&quot; he said. &quot;In a similar way, I hope we can inspire something similar with coding agents.&quot;</p>\n<p>Bent says the original learning mode came out of conversations Anthropic had with university students, who kept referring back to the concept of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_rot\">brain rot</a>. &quot;We found that they themselves realized that when they just copy and paste something directly from a chat bot, it's not good for their long-term learning,&quot; he said. When it came time to adapt the feature to Claude Code, the company wanted to balance the needs of new programmers with those like Bent who have been coding for a decade or more.</p>\n<p>&quot;Learning mode is designed to help all of those audiences not just complete tasks, but also help them grow and learn in the process and better understand their code base,&quot; Bent said. His hope is that the new tools will allow any coder to become a &quot;really good engineering manager.&quot; In practice, that means those users won't necessarily write most of the code on a project, but they will develop a keen eye for how everything fits together and what sections of code might need some more work.</p>\n<p>Looking forward, Bent says Anthropic doesn't &quot;have all the answers, but needless to say, we're trying to think through other features we can build&quot; that expand on what it's doing with learning mode. To that end, the company is opening up Claude Code's new Output Styles to developers, allowing them to build their own learning modes. Users too can modify how Claude communicates by <a href=\"https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/10181068-configuring-and-using-styles\">creating their own custom prompts for the chatbot</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-brings-claudes-learning-mode-to-regular-users-and-devs-170018471.html?src=rss",

Gamescom is the planet's largest gaming event and we're sure to find out about a bunch of interesting new games at the Opening Night Live showcase (and, fingers crossed, maybe get a <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>release date?). Xbox is broadcasting from the show floor across two days, and there will be other presentations that are worth keeping an eye on.</p>\n<p>Gamescom is taking place between August 20 and 24 this year, and we're learning bits and pieces about what to expect from the various showcases. The affair will kick off with Opening Night Live, a showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley that bridges the gap between his two other major events, Summer Game Fest Live and The Game Awards. That will be followed by two days of Xbox broadcasts, the latest edition of the Future Games Show and three days of Bethesda streams.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There will also be news from Ubisoft on what's next for <em>The Division 2</em>. The company will <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1955638110798201174\">host two panels</a> related to the franchise during Gamescom. One will include more info about <em>The Division Resurgence</em> (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-delays-its-rainbow-six-and-division-mobile-games-until-at-least-april-2025-174035060.html\">a delayed mobile game</a>), as well details about a \"big Division 2 project.\"</p>\n<p>We'll update this preview with more Gamescom details as we get them, and embed video versions of each stream as they become available too.

The two-hour showcase will feature the \"worldwide reveal\" of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. </em>We'll almost certainly get a release date here too.</p>\n<p>Given that Microsoft has said <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>will be playable on PC and ROG Xbox Ally X at its Gamescom booth, and the game is still slated to arrive this year, this event seems as good a time as any for us to finally get a release date for that thing — <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/that-one-time-i-played-hollow-knight-silksong-160022483.html\">over six years after we first got to try it out</a>. There will certainly be more eyeballs on ONL than Microsoft's own streams, so that seems like the likeliest bet for any concrete <em>Silksong </em>news at Gamescom.</p>\n<p>You can also expect a trailer for multiplayer RPG <em>Honor of Kings: World, </em>along with <a href=\"https://www.gematsu.com/event/gamescom-2025-opening-night-live\">new looks</a> at <em>Resident Evil Requiem, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em> and<em> The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin. </em>You'll get to see the opening cinematic for <em>World of Warcraft</em>'s <em>Midnight</em> expansion as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It won't all be game reveals and announcements, though — there'll be a performance of music from <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>featuring composer Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier. Additionally, you'll get a peek at season two of Prime Video's <em>Fallout </em>series, which will arrive in December.</p>\n<p>We'll be keeping tabs on all the news from Opening Night Live right here on Engadget.

As spotted by <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/08/13/google-messages-sensitive-content-warnings-2/\"><em><ins>9to5Google</ins></em></a>, the company is making Sensitive Content Warnings more broadly available after <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-messages-starts-rolling-out-sensitive-content-warnings-for-nude-images-130525437.html\"><ins>beta testing the option since April</ins></a>.

However, it’ll only work if you’re signed into a Google Account in the Messages app.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>When Messages detects and blurs such an image, you will be able to choose between several actions. You can access a resource page called &quot;Learn why nude images can be harmful,&quot; block the sender’s number, return to the main Messages screen or opt to dismiss or view the image (tap Next and then either &quot;No, don’t view&quot; or &quot;Yes, view&quot;).</p>\n<p>A warning will appear when you go to send or forward a nude image too. Your device will remind you of the risk of doing so and you will have to acknowledge confirmation before you send the image.</p>\n<p>Sensitive Content Warnings is enabled by default for supervised users and parents and guardians can manage it via the Family Link app. Unsupervised teens aged between 13 and 17 can switch off the feature from their Google Account settings. Adults will have to opt in if they want to use the feature. They can do so by going to Google Messages Settings &gt; Protection &amp; Safety &gt; Manage sensitive content warnings &gt; Warnings in Google Messages.</p>\n<p>Google has designed this feature with privacy in mind. Your device will process and classify the images locally with the help of Android System SafetyCore tools. No identifiable data, classified content or results associated with this safety feature (including any detected nude images) are sent to Google servers, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/messages/answer/15724426?hl=en\">the company says</a>. Google also notes that the feature isn't perfect — it may occasionally incorrectly determine that an image contains nudity when it doesn't, or allow ones that do feature nudity to pass through undetected.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-messages-can-now-blur-nude-images-on-android-150305780.html?src=rss",

While you can continue to use Windows 10 PCs after that date — and it's understandable why, I gave it a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-28-windows-10-review.html\">glowing review</a> at launch — you'll no longer receive any customer support, security updates or any other sort of upgrades. Windows 10 will effectively become a zombie operating system, shuffling along until some sort of malware or massive security breach renders it far too insecure. (Think about it this way: Would you actually feel safe running Windows XP, a notoriously malware-prone OS that hasn't received a significant security update since 2019, today? I would hope not!)</p>\n<p>So what's a Windows 10 user to do? Let's consider your choices.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-best-option-upgrade-to-windows-11\">The best option: Upgrade to Windows 11</h2>\n<p>For most users, the simplest way to move on from Windows 10 is to step up to Microsoft's new OS. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040-200028741.html\">Windows 11 </a>is a free upgrade for Windows 10 users running the latest 22HS update and who also meet the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=67071605-d4df-494e-8d9c-c9c236b8bb38&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1ef2905f-b731-403b-8357-0ea175334b36&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Microsoft&amp;linkText=minimum+hardware+specifications&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3dpbmRvd3Mvd2luZG93cy0xMS1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMWVmMjkwNWYtYjczMS00MDNiLTgzNTctMGVhMTc1MzM0YjM2Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWNyb3NvZnQuY29tL2VuLXVzL3dpbmRvd3Mvd2luZG93cy0xMS1zcGVjaWZpY2F0aW9ucyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVxHGHrs91w2Kpanl0rPvDovVCqJRYlzrn120q64n5Be&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fwindows-11-specifications\">minimum hardware specifications</a>. Microsoft isn't asking for much — just a 1 GHz dual-core 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage -— but security requirements may be a problem for very old PCs.

Windows 11 relies on the latter for biometric logins, BitLocker data encryption and other security features. If you don't have TPM 2.0, you'll be stuck with Windows 10 until you get a new PC.</p>\n<p>If that all sounds too complicated, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1ef2905f-b731-403b-8357-0ea175334b36&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Microsoft%27s+PC+Health+Check+app&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAUWLMYFxh16drbFAk3euOpr1NYoouaJEY8y0BsGJi6Hu&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fcheck-if-a-device-meets-windows-11-system-requirements-after-changing-device-hardware-f3bc0aeb-6884-41a1-ab57-88258df6812b\">Microsoft's PC Health Check app</a> can also let you know if your system is ready for Windows 11. And if you've been bombarded by Windows 11 upgrade notifications over the past few years, that's also a not-so-subtle nudge that your PC is likely ready for the new OS. (There are various hacks that can let you install Windows 11 without TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, but they’re risky and could make your OS installation vulnerable.)</p>\n<p>If you do choose to upgrade, you can expect a relatively painless process. Gone are the days when a Windows upgrade could easily wipe out your entire system. Now you can expect all of your software (and their respective licenses) to carry over, but with yet another caveat for Office suites: Microsoft is also <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/end-of-support/resources\">ending support for Office 2016 and Office 2019</a> on October 14, 2025 as well. Cloud-based Microsoft 365 apps should be good to go on Windows 11 as well (see below for Windows 10 limitations).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Assuming you've got enough hard drive space to hold the new OS, the upgrade process is merely a matter of sitting back and watching your system reboot a few times. I'd still recommend backing up any essential data before upgrading, though, just in case you run into any issues. (Pairing a cloud-based Microsoft OneDrive backup with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-portable-ssd-120043652.html\">local hard disk</a> is a good belt and suspenders solution.)</p>\n<div id=\"62e45afdb5c4410a974b97d393ddcbc1\"></div>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-pricey-option-buy-a-new-pc\">The pricey option: Buy a new PC</h2>\n<p>If your system is too old to support Secure Boot mode and TPM 2.0, it’s probably just time for an upgrade. (Expert users can find workarounds on YouTube and elsewhere, but you need to be adventurous enough to handle the likes of Github downloads and security overrides.)

Be sure to check out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-120008636.html\">our best laptop guide</a>, which includes some tips on the best specs to seek out, as well as some of our favorite systems like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/dell-premium-14-review-new-name-same-great-laptop-120047563.html\">Dell 14 Premium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-inch-and-15-inch-review-minimal-upgrades-at-a-much-better-price-130002570.html\">MacBook Air</a> (because it’s also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-is-it-a-good-time-to-move-to-macs-from-windows-145159396.html\">a good time to consider switching from Windows to Macs</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-windows-laptop-130018256.html\">best Windows laptops guide</a> also highlights systems like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/asus-zenbook-s14-review-a-showpiece-for-intels-lunar-lake-ai-pc-chips-171642261.html\">ASUS ZenBook S14</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/surface-pro-copilot-review-the-best-surface-tablet-ever-made-no-thanks-to-ai-160039966.html\">Surface Pro Copilot+ tablet</a>. While the sweetspot for new PCs tends to be in the $750 to $1,200 range, with current back-to-school promos, you can find very capable laptops and desktops for as low as $500, and occasionally less. But if you're looking for something higher end ($1,400 and up), our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html\">best gaming laptop guide</a> would be helpful.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-risky-option-keep-on-trucking-with-windows-10\">The risky option: Keep on trucking with Windows 10</h2>\n<p>Windows 10 won't self-destruct when its support ends, so you could conceivably just use your older PC until it dies. But that's a risky option since you won't be getting any security updates. All it takes is for one intrepid hacker to find a new security flaw and you could easily fall victim to any number of issues. That includes getting malware, which could slow down performance and leak your data to hackers, or falling victim to a ransomware data theft scheme. And every day past October 14 just raises the likelihood of OS-level vulnerabilities that third-party antivirus software would be ill-equipped to fight off. Trust me – you don't want to do this. At the very least, buy yourself another year to figure things out</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-procrastinator-option-pay-to-extend-windows-10s-security-updates\">The procrastinator option: Extend Windows 10's security updates for one year&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>If your hardware can't support the move to Windows 11, you can at least hit the snooze button by subscribing to the Windows 10 extended update (ESU) program. While it was initially announced as a $30 offering, Microsoft has since made it a free option if you <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2025/06/24/stay-secure-with-windows-11-copilot-pcs-and-windows-365-before-support-ends-for-windows-10/\">synchronize your Windows 10 settings</a> to the cloud via Windows Backup, or you could shell out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/windows-10-users-can-get-extended-security-updates-for-1000-microsoft-rewards-points-170023129.html\">1,000 Microsoft reward points</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As its name implies, the ESU will get you Windows 10 security updates, bug fixes and technical support until October 13, 2026. It also extends support for cloud-based <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-apps/end-of-support/windows-10-support\">Microsoft 365 apps</a> through August 2026 for individuals and families. Sure, it's only a year of additional support, but that can at least buy you enough time to do more research on a new PC, or wait for a holiday sale. For what it's worth, this marks the first time Microsoft has offered any sort of ESU to consumers. Typically, they're just a way for corporate IT admins to get additional support without migrating to a new OS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-have-a-tech-question-youd-like-engadget-to-answer\">Have a tech question you’d like Engadget to answer?</h2>\n<p>As tech reporters, the Engadget staff is always answering questions from friends and family about electronics, software, gaming, big tech policies and more.

Part of that comes from an already lower starting price for the MacBooks than their predecessors. The 2025 models also get a speed boost thanks to the M4 chip and are very thin with a 0.44-inch thickness. Neither the 13- or 15-inch will drag you down, weighing 2.7 pounds and 3.2 pounds, respectively. Plus, they both have excellent battery life, lasting over 18 hours while playing an HD video.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The big differences in the 15-inch model mostly come down to size. The screen is obviously bigger, as is its trackpad. Other than that, it offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling.&nbsp;</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p><em>Check out our coverage of the </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html\"><em>best Apple deals</em></a><em> for more discounts, and follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/macbook-air-deal-the-m4-powered-laptop-is-on-sale-for-as-low-as-799-123031852.html?src=rss",

Once Apple begins rolling out the software, you'll need to update your devices to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1 to access the reworked feature. Following the update, any blood oxygen data captured by your Apple Watch will be calculated on your iPhone, with the resulting data viewable in the respiratory section of the Health app.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"There will be no impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased that include the original Blood Oxygen feature, nor to Apple Watch units purchased outside of the US,\" Apple said.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Today's update marks another unexpected development in Apple's long, drawn out legal feud with Masimo. In 2021, the medical device maker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/masimo-apple-watch-series-6-itc-import-ban/\">sued Apple</a>, alleging the tech giant had infringed on its intellectual properties related to pulse oximeter blood-oxygen monitoring technology. Following a couple of years of legal back and forth, the issue came to a head when the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/itc-rules-against-apple-in-patent-dispute-setting-up-potential-ban-181123636.html\">US International Trade Commission</a> (ITC) upheld a prior ruling that found Apple had violated Masimo's patents. After former President Biden chose not to veto the decision, Apple was forced to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-pause-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-in-the-us-due-to-a-patent-dispute-142051903.html\">temporarily pause</a> sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The company later started selling the wearables again <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-will-remove-blood-oxygen-app-from-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-to-evade-us-import-ban-194517839.html\">following an update</a> the removed the infringing blood oxygen monitoring feature. Now Apple says it's able to offer the functionality again, with a slight modification, due to a recent US Customs ruling.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-redesigned-blood-oxygen-monitoring-feature-hits-apple-watches-in-the-us-today-131558485.html?src=rss",

      "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-antigravity-a1-drone-preview-hands-on-130034274.html?src=rss",
      "summary": "<p>If DJI is entering the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-osmo-360-review-a-capable-action-cam-thats-a-real-threat-to-insta360-120019592.html\">360-degree action camera market</a>, why shouldn't Insta360 venture into drones? That was my immediate thought when the company announced its first drone, the A1, from a spin-off brand and team called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-spin-off-antigravity-360-degree-video-drone-130048742.html\">Antigravity</a>.</p>\n<p>So, what is the A1? Is it an entry-level device? A camera for creators looking to spice up their videos without years of practice? A competitive POV drone? It’s a bit of all three, but the Antigravity A1 isn’t just a drone. It will eventually launch in a three-part set: the flying unit, OLED Vision goggles and a dedicated Grip motion controller.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In its current form, the Antigravity A1 weighs around 249 grams (8.8 ounces), which helps it duck around drone license requirements in most regions. (As it’s a preproduction model, this could change a little before it hits retail.) Two ultrawide cameras are positioned on the roof and underside of the drone instead of on the front. It’s like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-x5-launch-date-price-hands-on-132439941.html\">Insta360 X5 camera</a> is some sort of cocoon for the Antigravity A1.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Antigravity A1 drone hands-on\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/909afc20-7848-11f0-bfdf-530bdf9d71aa\" style=\"height: 1288px; width: 2289px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>With those two camera units, the A1 can capture video in 8K resolution, stretched across a sphere-like canvas from the drone’s point of view. With stitching algorithms that the company has continually improved over five generations of 360-degree cameras, this should result in mostly seamless footage where the A1 never interrupts the view.  The drone itself won’t show up in your video. It’s like the company’s “invisible” selfie stick, but, well, up in the sky.</p>\n<p>The A1 is unlike any other drone I’ve played with — something I learned when I tested a pre-production unit at a Mercedes-Benz race track in Schlüsselfeld, Germany. Naturally, this included high-speed cars, wet conditions and some near-misses.</p>\n<p>Thanks to working at Engadget, I’m a drone dabbler, but Antigravity’s A1 is a different experience from the outset. Controlling the A1 involves strapping on companion goggles and steering it from a first-person perspective, controller in hand. However, unlike other FPV drones, you can look (and move) anywhere you want.</p>\n<div id=\"2224f835e99b412aaf1848c3de7b61da\"></div>\n<p>During roughly 15 minutes of flying time (you can see the highlights here), I found it’s a surprisingly intuitive experience. With other FPV drones, your view is locked to the direction of the camera. Sure, you can rotate rival drones to see elsewhere, like with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/dji-avata-2-fpv-drone-review-a-cheaper-more-potent-tool-for-creators-130052278.html\">DJI’s Avata</a>, but it’s not the same. Because the A1 streams 360-degree video to the goggles, turning your head will never affect the direction it’s facing. Instead, you’ll just see what’s around the drone as it flies, making it far more intuitive for rookie drone pilots. Better still, you can strafe and move around while looking somewhere else — like video game controls for a first-person shooter.</p>\n<p>This freedom of movement is elevated by the unique A1 controller, which is best described as a blend between a traditional drone controller and a Wiimote. While some of the physical buttons and dials adjust altitude, start/stop video recording and more, steering involves a point-and-click method. When you move your hand out to the right side, a reticle shows up on the goggles’ display. Pressing the trigger then will cause the A1 to shoot out in that direction, an action that Antigravity calls Freemotion control.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned, this means I don’t have to look where I’m going — although it’s better if I do to avoid accidents (or collisions with an expensive Mercedes). If you’ve been intrigued by FPV drones, this is a simpler experience that feels freer, too. You can look wherever you want, not beholden to where cameras are pointed on other drones. I also think I could get friends and family flying the A1 around with minimal training. Speaking of spectators, Insta360 included a clever touch for them: the goggles have an external screen so that onlookers can see what’s happening. There is nothing duller than watching someone else fly a drone without being able to see their POV.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Antigravity A1 drone hands-on\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/909ad510-7848-11f0-af5d-8ffc14cca897\" style=\"height: 1153px; width: 2050px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>The A1 is a zippy little drone, presumably thanks to its low weight. But even at this preproduction stage, the resulting video looks better than I thought it would. Plus, it offers substantial versatility if you’re looking for action-packed shots.</p>\n<p>After I tested the A1, Antigravity sent me my video from the drone, so I was about to reframe, crop and reposition the footage. You could even use the same 10 seconds and frame (or crop) to three very different angles. For example, you could extract a tracking shot of the car, a zoomed-in shot of the drone pilot or just the blue skies of Germany all from one clip. That’s the exciting part here.</p>\n<p>Insta360 built excellent editing tools (mobile and desktop) for its cameras in the past, and it plans to do the same for its first drone. An early version of the software wasn’t without its hiccups, but editing was easy enough once I figured out that keyframes would anchor the drone's view. I could then add several keyframes together, tagging objects I’d like to keep in frame or track. Editing my footage started to get oddly enjoyable, and I have <em>never</em> enjoyed that task.</p>\n<p>Another feature the company emphasized is payload detection. While the exact weight limit is still being refined through further testing, Antigravity says the A1 won’t be able to fly if the drone detects it’s carrying something it shouldn’t — a move to further smooth potential license issues. The company also hinted at future accessories and peripherals to expand the A1 experience — something it has successfully done with its action cams and gimbals.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Antigravity A1 drone hands-on\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/909afc21-7848-11f0-bb7f-27f1814bb63c\" style=\"height: 1294px; width: 2300px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Image by Mat Smith for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Some specs are still a mystery because the drone is a work in progress. To that end, the company is <a href=\"http://www.antigravity.tech/\">opening up applications</a> for a co-creation project, where participants will get a pre-production Antigravity A1 in exchange for offering feedback. Ideas from these testers will be integrated into the final retail version, and the best ones could win a share of a $20,000 prize pool.</p>\n<p>Flying the A1 around a racetrack was the most fun I've had with a drone in a long time. But, with goggles and a dedicated controller included, how much will a flight cost? That might decide whether Insta360’s Antigravity can carve out a place next to DJI’s army of drones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/insta360-antigravity-a1-drone-preview-hands-on-130034274.html?src=rss",

As <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/758606/cowboys-e-bikes-rebirth-avoids-bankruptcy\"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, Rebirth is the parent of ReCycles, the prominent French manufacturer that <a href=\"https://cowboy.com/blogs/press/designed-in-belgium-now-assembled-in-france\">took over bike assembly</a> for Cowboy back in February.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For quite some time, the company's fate was up in the air. Cowboy explained that over the past couple of years, it has been hit by several problems that are plaguing the whole industry, including the post-COVID shifts in the demand for e-bikes and massive supply chain problems. On top of those, it <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/08/14/a-big-recall-nearly-killed-this-e-bike-company-now-it-may-have-just-been-saved/\">had to launch a recall</a> for some of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cowboy-cruiser-e-bike-offers-a-more-upright-ride-000010102.html\">Cruiser ST bikes</a> when their frames started to crack after 2,500 kilometers (1,553 miles), which Cowboy said &quot;added strain to an already difficult time.&quot; It explained that the issue was caused by one of its suppliers making an unauthorized change to the bikes.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Cowboy has admitted that due to the issues it faced, customers experienced a lot of delays and that it wasn't able to communicate things with them clearly. Now that it has secured financing, the first replacement frames for the recalled bikes have finally arrived from its supplier and it was able to start operating its first recall center, with more to follow in the summer. &quot;We are not yet where we want to be, but we are here,&quot; the company said <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybikes/comments/1mpuh51/cowboy_just_emailed_me_with_an_update_on_their/\">in the email</a> it has sent its customers. &quot;Still standing.

So, the Air would stand out from its peers in that respect.

It's expected to house three cameras (as before), but multiple rumors have suggested it will have an improved telephoto one. The zoom lens could <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/\">jump</a> to 48MP, which would strengthen its digital zooming / cropping chops.

The company is also expected to roll out new Apple Watch models. 5G and a processor upgrade are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-10/apple-plans-apple-watch-ultra-3-next-year-with-satellite-texting-and-5g\">expected</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra 3. It may also let you send texts via satellite, handy for those who use it out in the wilderness. Regardless of the details, Apple hasn't launched a new rugged and premium model since 2023 (apart from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/theres-no-apple-watch-ultra-series-3-just-a-new-color-and-a-new-band-173236966.html\">a new color</a>), so it's due for an upgrade.</p>\n<p>The Series 11 model is unlikely to depart dramatically from the Series 10. After all, that model introduced a new design, with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-10-review-legacy-and-sequel-in-equal-measure-120021405.html\">thinner body and larger screen</a>. (And Apple has historically kept those around in three-year cycles.). But a faster chip also seems logical.

      "summary": "<p>Tablets are the perfect middle ground between your phone and laptop, giving you the best of both worlds. Whether you want a lightweight device to binge your favorite shows, a larger screen for mobile gaming or a portable way to get some work done on the go, a tablet can do it all. They’re also great for keeping kids entertained, managing work tasks or sharing family moments through video calls. When a phone feels too small and lugging around a laptop is just too much, that’s where tablets fit into the mix.<br /><br />For many, the Apple iPad is the go-to choice, and it’s easy to see why with its smooth performance and endless app options. But don’t worry if iOS isn’t your thing — there are plenty of Android alternatives out there, offering the same level of flexibility without locking you into Apple’s ecosystem. Plus, if you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options that still pack a punch. Whether you’re looking for a premium tablet for work, a kid-friendly device with parental controls or just a reliable everyday companion, we’ve tested all of the big players (and many others) to find the best tablets worth your money right now.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-best-tablets-for-2025\">Best tablets for 2025</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-important-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-tablet\">Important things to consider before buying a tablet</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-how-we-test-tablets\">How we test tablets</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-other-tablets-we-tested\">Other tablets we tested</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-tablet-faqs\">Tablet FAQs</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-tablet-accessories\">Tablet accessories</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-tablets-for-2025\">Best tablets for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-important-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-tablet\">Important things to consider before buying a tablet</h2> \n<p>Before you start looking at specific devices, the number one thing you should do is figure out what you plan to use your new tablet for. That’s because if all you need is something to keep a kid busy, buying a brand new Apple iPad Air or iPad Pro doesn’t make a ton of sense. On the flip side, if you want to use a tablet for video editing or drawing, you’ll need to take things like performance, versatility and stylus support more seriously — especially if you're considering using it as a laptop replacement.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>You’ll also want to think about stuff like how often you plan on traveling with the device and if it’s more for productivity, or for less demanding stuff like web browsing or streaming shows. There’s also an important trade-off to consider when it comes to battery life as well. Larger devices tend to have longer runtimes, though an increase in size may make it less portable.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-tablets\">How we test tablets</h2> \n<p>When evaluating different tablets, there are a few important things we look for above all else: solid performance, a good screen and long battery life. For performance, we run a handful of synthetic tests like Geekbench 6, while also performing a number of hands-on, real-world use cases such as editing photos and playing games. And with tablets often serving as hybrid devices, we also consider how easy it is to multitask and switch quickly between various apps. The more responsive a device feels, the better.</p> \n<p>Because a tablet’s display is such a critical component, we also view a wide range of content to gauge things like brightness, color gamut and dynamic range. It’s important to take into account the difference between various panel types like OLED, which typically produce richer colors and excellent contrast but may not be as bright as a mini LED display. Recently, refresh rate has become an increasingly important spec as 90Hz and 120Hz screens can make scrolling smoother and graphics appear sharper in games.</p> \n<p>We also consider a tablet’s design (including things like size, weight and water resistance), its connectivity (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC, 5G, et cetera) and special features like stylus support or the ability to serve as a secondary display. That’s because, while tablets were often viewed as content consumption devices in the past, higher-end devices like the Surface Pro and iPad Pro are more than capable of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html\">replacing a laptop</a> for a lot of people.</p> \n<p>Finally, we test battery life by running our standard local video rundown test, which involves playing a single video on a loop from 100 percent until it runs out of juice. Ideally, a tablet should be able to last an entire working day, but longer runtimes are always welcome — especially for users relying on them for productivity, entertainment and storage options on the go.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-tablets-we-tested\">Other tablets we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-apple-ipad-mini\">Apple iPad mini</h3> \n<p>Apple updated the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-mini-7-review-safe-boring-and-everything-i-want-in-a-small-tablet-130039378.html\">iPad mini</a> for 2024 with some under-the-hood changes including a new processor and additional RAM to help support Apple Intelligence features. While the iPad mini is one of the best iPads you can buy, its small size makes it a bit niche. Only if you prefer your tablet be the size of an ereader should you consider this one.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-google-pixel-tablet\">Google Pixel Tablet</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-tablet-review-clever-accessories-transform-an-unexciting-tablet-070147119.html\">Google Pixel Tablet</a> excels as a smart display rather than a simple tablet. As the latter, it's unexciting, but when paired with its speaker/charging dock, it becomes much more useful. It could be a good option for those that already live within the Google ecosystem and use the Google Assistant often, or those who like the idea of a tablet that can be docked and used as a smart display as well.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-oneplus-pad\">OnePlus Pad</h3> \n<p>The solid <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-pad-review-solid-hardware-thats-let-down-by-android-130039695.html\">OnePlus Pad</a> is let down by Android because there aren't many Android apps designed to be used on a large display like this model's 11.6-inch panel. Otherwise, the hardware is well-designed, its companion stylus is comfortable to use and it has an excellent battery life.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-tablet-faqs\">Tablet FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-best-brand-for-tablets\">What is the best brand for tablets?</h3> \n<p>The best brand for tablets is really the brand you feel most comfortable with. We recommend taking stock of the gadgets you already have — do you live in the Apple ecosystem already? An iPad might be best for you then. Do you have a Samsung phone? If so, a Galaxy Tab will likely be the most convenient choice. There is no one \"best brand\" for tablets; you’ll find good options made by companies including Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft and Amazon.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-a-tablet-replace-a-laptop\">Can a tablet replace a laptop?</h3> \n<p>It’s possible for a tablet to replace a laptop, but you’ll need a few accessories to truly make the experience as close as possible to that of a traditional notebook. A keyboard is a must, be it a keyboard case or a Bluetooth accessory that you keep with you. Some keyboard cases, like apple’s Magic Keyboard for the iPad, have a built-in trackpad, which will be more ergonomic than tapping on your tablet’s screen for input. Additionally, you could go one step further and use a wireless mouse that connects via Bluetooth to your tablet. If you’re primarily looking for a tablet to replace your laptop, consider buying a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html\">2-in-1 laptop</a> since those systems typically consist of high-powered tablets that are designed to work well with (and without) keyboards.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-size-screen-do-i-need\">What size screen do I need?</h3> \n<p>Figuring out the best screen size for you will also be related to the kind of work (or play) you intend to do. Larger screens make it much easier to view two apps side by side, and big screens also deliver a more immersive movie viewing experience — especially when paired with an OLED display or Liquid Retina display. But at the same time, the larger the tablet, the less likely you’re going to want to move it around. That means you’re not only going to want to take stock of your workspace (i.e., if you have a desk or instead plan to work from a couch or even your bed), but you’re also going to want to think about how the device will fit into your everyday routine or commute (if you have one).</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-tablet-accessories\">Tablet accessories</h2> \n<p>Finally, you’ll want to consider any add-ons or accessories you’re planning to use, which can range from detachable keyboards to things like external mics or a stylus. The good news is that many of the best tablets nowadays offer some kind of keyboard accessory, which allows the device to function more like a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html\">2-in-1</a> instead of simply being a content consumption device. Some tablets also feature things like microSD card slots that support expandable storage, or optional 4G or 5G connectivity, which can be a real boon to frequent travelers. And if you’re planning to use the tablet mainly for work, you might want to grab a USB hub for connecting all your favorite peripherals so your devices don’t have to fight for the charger.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>July 2025:</strong> Updated to ensure our top picks and buying advice remain accurate.</p> \n<p><strong>May 2025:</strong> Updated to ensure our top picks and buying advice remain accurate.</p> \n<p><strong>March 2025:</strong> Updated to include the latest base iPad in our top picks,</p> \n<p><strong>February 2025:</strong> Updated to include clarification around our top picks and new buying advice.</p> \n<p><strong>October 2024:</strong> We updated this list to include information on the new iPad mini 7.</p> \n<p><strong>June 2024:</strong> We updated our top picks to include the Microsoft Surface Pro Copilot+ edition.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-tablets-150026056.html?src=rss",

During Apple's recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook said its collection of upcoming beta operating systems (including iOS) are \"by far the most popular developer betas we’ve had,\" <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/08/01/tim-cook-ios-26-is-by-far-apples-most-popular-beta-ever/\"><em>9to5Mac </em>reports</a>. You can also take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">preview of the iOS 26 public beta release</a>, which shows off the fresh home and lock screen redesign. Called <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">Liquid Glass</a>, the new translucent look will extend across all of Apple's upcoming operating systems. The overhaul is one of several big changes coming to iOS, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">iPadOS</a> and the rest of Apple's software suite, all of which were showcased during the company's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/wwdc-2025-everything-apple-announced-including-ios-26-liquid-glass-design-and-more-171718030.html\">WWDC keynote</a> on June 9.</p>\n<p>After overpromising on AI plans last year, Apple kept its iOS roadmap focused more on basic quality of life improvements this year. There are multiple useful additions coming to the Phone and Messages apps on your iPhone, for instance: Apple execs outlined the ability to weed out spam texts or other unknown senders and an option to hold your spot on a phone call when you've been waiting for a representative to pick up. Plus, a treasured feature that we took for granted is coming back (hint: it's in the Photos app).</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Siri, meanwhile, is in a holding pattern. Apple has previously specified that its smarter voice assistant — first promised at WWDC 2024 — is delayed until some point \"<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-delaying-its-smarter-more-personal-siri-183513424.html\">in the coming year</a>,\" so you shouldn't expect any major changes in the current betas. But there are reports that Apple is aiming to give Siri a bigger brain transplant by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/30/apple-chatgpt-claude-siri/\">basing it on third-party artificial intelligence models</a> like OpenAI's ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, which could make 2026 a pivotal year. The company is also reportedly working on a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-reportedly-has-a-stripped-down-ai-chatbot-to-compete-with-chatgpt-in-the-works-164345473.html\">'stripped-down' AI chatbot</a> to rival ChatGPT.</p>\n<p>With each beta, it seems like additional new improvements are popping up, like this <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">new AirPods gesture</a> we're all curious about, and this FaceTime feature that'll <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze your video if it detects nudity</a>. With the release of the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">iOS 26 developer beta 5</a>, we saw more added features, like a new bouncy animation on the passcode screen and in the Control Center, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/ios-26-beta-5-features/\"><em>MacRumors </em>reports</a>. Some or all of those changes will likely soon migrate into the separate public beta (see below). Most newer iPhone models are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-is-releasing-ios-26-this-fall-heres-the-full-list-of-compatible-iphones-191854795.html\">eligible to download iOS 26 </a>(both the betas and final version). Want to see the full list of new features coming this fall? Read on.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-ios-26\">What is iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>The current iPhone operating system is iOS 18, and Apple is still actively updating it — <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-6-features/\">version 18.6</a> was just recently released. But don't expect to see iOS 19. Instead, Apple is skipping the numbering ahead to iOS 26 later this year. The company has decided to line up its iOS version numbers with a year-based system, similar to car model years. So while iOS and its sibling operating systems will be released in late 2025, they're all designated \"26\" to reflect the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"a list of the new OSes\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/29bbb6f0-4555-11f0-b2de-ada42a83075d\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>It's official, we're moving to iOS 26. (Apple)</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-is-liquid-glass-design\">What is Liquid Glass design?</h2>\n<p>Let's be honest. Out of everything announced at WWDC this year, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apples-new-liquid-glass-design-is-its-biggest-visual-update-in-years-172158766.html\">new Liquid Glass design</a> was the star of the show. The iPhone's home and lock screens have looked pretty much the same year after year — the last exciting thing (in my opinion) was the option to add your own aesthetic to your home screen by customizing your apps and widgets. So seeing the home and lock screens' new facelift is refreshing.</p>\n<p>So what exactly is Liquid Glass? Apple calls it a \"<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86b7b54f-7ccd-4fbb-a927-09c327b93cbc&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=new+translucent+material&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vbmV3c3Jvb20vMjAyNS8wNi9hcHBsZS1lbGV2YXRlcy10aGUtaXBob25lLWV4cGVyaWVuY2Utd2l0aC1pb3MtMjYvIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmI3YjU0Zi03Y2NkLTRmYmItYTkyNy0wOWMzMjdiOTNjYmMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9uZXdzcm9vbS8yMDI1LzA2L2FwcGxlLWVsZXZhdGVzLXRoZS1pcGhvbmUtZXhwZXJpZW5jZS13aXRoLWlvcy0yNi8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVivyXXsD7DiKwA3X-v-YLSp-mKPz8KpUrb1ctVS4Hji&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2025%2F06%2Fapple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26%2F\">new translucent material</a>\" since, well, the apps and widgets are clear. However, the screen can still adapt to dark and light modes, depending on surroundings. You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design in several apps, like Phone and Maps. They're designed to be less distracting than the current buttons, but are still easy to see. While the design overhaul has proven to be controversial since its announcement, some — including Engadget's own Devindra Hardawar — like the new direction, even if it's somewhat reminiscent of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-liquid-glass-is-windows-vista-done-well-181954910.html\">Microsoft's translucent Windows Vista Aero designs</a> from nearly twenty years ago.</p>\n<p>That said, as of the release of the iOS 26 beta 2, Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">has already incorporated some user feedback</a> into the design, dialing back the transparency in at least some places. And while it will continue to evolve, Apple users won't be able to escape it: Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive. Here's a look at how the translucent aesthetic will look with <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-tahoe-26-will-bring-apples-new-liquid-glass-ui-to-your-desktop-174149070.html\">the new macOS Tahoe 26</a> on your desktop.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-new-and-notable-features-of-ios-26\">What are the new and notable features of iOS 26?</h2>\n<p>iOS 26 has a laundry list of new features. Among the most worthwhile:</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music and continue on with other tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translation in Phone, FaceTime and Messages:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translation will translate your conversation in real time, which results in some stop-and-go interactions in the examples Apple shared during its presentation.</p>\n<p><strong>Polls in group chats:</strong> Tired of sorting through what seems like hundreds of messages in your group chat? You and your friends will soon be able to create polls in group messages for deciding things like which brunch spot you're eating at or whose car you're taking on a road trip.</p>\n<p><strong>Filtering unknown senders in Messages:</strong> If you haven't received spam texts about unpaid tolls or other citations, you're lucky. For those of us who have, those annoying messages will soon be filtered away in a separate folder.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Intelligence:</strong> Similar to a reverse Google image search, this new feature will allow you to search for anything that's on your iPhone screen. For instance, if you spot a pair of shoes someone is wearing in an Instagram photo, you can <a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-take-a-screenshot-on-your-iphone-133139822.html\">screenshot it and use Visual Intelligence</a> to find those shoes (or similar ones) online.</p>\n<p><strong>Photos tabs are back:</strong> For anyone who's still frustrated with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-apple-redesigned-its-photos-app-around-customization-120038901.html\">Photos changes made last year</a>, you'll be happy to know that your tabs are coming back. Library and Collections will have their own separate spaces so you don't have to scroll to infinity to find what you're looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature: </strong>A newer addition to iOS 26 appears to be the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">FaceTime \"Communication Safety\" feature</a> that pauses communications if and when nudity is detected. The feature appears to be a child safety feature that uses on-device detection, thus obviating any cloud-based privacy issues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/article/how-to-customize-your-iphones-lock-screen-on-ios-26-110535863.html\"><strong>New lock screen options</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The iPhone lock screen gets more customizable in iOS 26, with a cooler clock, 3D wallpaper effects, more widgets and better focus mode options.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"New Hold Assist being displayed at the wwdc keynote\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-06/a506ddc0-4556-11f0-9d7a-9a93e6a181c1\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" /><figcaption>Apple's Hold Assist will be nifty for those pesky services that put you on hold for 10 or more minutes.

Here's what's coming this fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Multitasking and real windowing:</strong> When you download the newest update, you'll be able to have multiple apps running on your screen at the same time. Once you open an app, it'll appear on your screen as normal but you'll be able to resize and move it across your screen to make room for other apps. This feature is optional so you can turn it off if you don't like it.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual update:</strong> Along with the other new OSes, iPadOS 26 is coming with the Liquid Glass aesthetic.

Here are some of the more notable functions.</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced audio recording:</strong> Apple calls this \"studio-quality\" audio recording, and with it, you'll notice more clarity while in noisy environments.</p>\n<p><strong>Camera remote control:</strong> Using this, you can take a photo or start and stop video recording with just one press on your AirPods. When taking photos, you'll get a three-second countdown before your iPhone or iPad snaps the picture.</p>\n<p><strong>Live translation feature:</strong> While not officially announced or confirmed, it appears that the long-rumored live translation for AirPods <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">could be coming with iOS 26</a>. The evidence comes from a system asset spotted in the in iOS 26 beta showing a gesture that's triggered by pressing both earbud stems at the same time.

      "summary": "<p>If Apple sticks to its usual schedule, we should see the company reveal its latest lineup of smartphones: the iPhone 17 models. The new models will come equipped with the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-public-beta-is-available-to-download-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-and-ipad-update-135749331.html?feature=disableNCPValidation\">latest iOS 26 features</a> preinstalled, along with whatever additional features Apple reveals at the launch event. But since we still have to wait a few weeks (presumably) until the iPhone event, we can at least speculate what the new phones will look like. As with most unreleased iPhone models, rumors and leaks have trickled in about the hardware side ahead of the official introduction. Here's what we're expecting and what we can reasonably assume we'll get from Cupertino in September.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-will-the-iphone-17-cost\">How much will the iPhone 17 cost?</h2>\n<p>Apple's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-to-invest-another-100-billion-into-the-us-to-avoid-tariffs-210250020.html\">announced plan to expand US-based manufacturing partners</a> seems to give it at least some shielding from the steepest Trump administration tariffs that have already triggered price increases on everything from <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-original-nintendo-switch-is-about-to-get-more-expensive-in-the-us-170646701.html\">Switch consoles</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/nikon-joins-other-camera-manufacturers-in-raising-prices-due-to-tariffs-120011854.html\">high-end cameras</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/sonos-is-raising-prices-this-year-to-make-up-for-tariff-expenses-123031336.html\">Sonos speakers</a>. But given that President Trump's trade policies can change from week to week, and Apple's continuing reliance on Asia-based supply chains, price shocks remain an ongoing possibility. The bigger question is: Will Apple absorb any higher costs, or pass them on to consumers?&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>If prices do creep up, Apple may choose to pair it with an &quot;upgrade.&quot; Consider this recent rumor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/06/will-iphone-17-pro-start-at-256gb-storage/\">posted by <em>MacRumors</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>from a leaker known as &quot;<a href=\"https://weibo.com/u/5143897135\">Instant Digital</a>,&quot; suggesting that the default storage of the iPhone 17 line may start at 256GB, doubling the current 128GB baseline. While that could be accompanied by a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/30/iphone-17-price-increase-expected/\">price increase of $50</a>, Apple could at least pitch it as a &quot;better value.&quot; That said, the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/every-macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-of-ram-at-no-extra-cost-150041320.html\">doubled the default RAM of its Mac computers</a> from 8GB to 16GB at no extra cost in 2024 — but that was before the current Trump tariff cycle started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-when-will-the-iphone-17s-be-announced\">When will the iPhone 17 series be announced?</h2>\n<p>Most years, the flagship smartphones are introduced in September. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-iphone-17-event-set-september-9/\"><em>MacRumors </em>highlighted</a> a story originally reported by <a href=\"https://www.iphone-ticker.de/iphone-17-vorstellung-wohl-am-9-verkaufsstart-am-19-september-261445/\">iphone-ticker.de</a> that the Apple iPhone 17 event could be Tuesday, September 9, according to information gleaned from German mobile phone providers.</p>\n<p>It's still too early to have the specific dates; some years, Apple only gives a week or two of lead time between sending invites and hosting the event. But years of past precedent show that sometime in September should be when the 17 models make their debut. This family of smartphones may be the last to follow that trend, however. There have been hints that the introduction of the iPhone 18 collection in 2026 will be <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-reportedly-wants-to-split-up-the-iphones-release-schedule-164737099.html\">split</a> into a pro-tier announcement in the fall and a standard model announcement the following spring.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-iphone-17-lineup-include\">What will the new iPhone 17 lineup include?</h2>\n<p>Design leaks suggest that Apple is building an <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-said-to-be-working-on-a-significantly-thinner-iphone-180823565.html\">ultra-thin smartphone</a>, likely to be named the iPhone 17 Air to match Apple's ultralight laptop designation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, often a solid source of advanced intel about Apple, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/this-year-could-bring-the-iphone-air-and-an-entry-level-ipad-with-apple-intelligence-175059162.html\">reported</a> in January that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a basic A19 chip and will only have a single camera lens. It may also use Apple's new in-house modem, which was introduced in February on the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-16e-review-whats-your-acceptable-compromise-020016288.html\">iPhone 16e</a>. More details about this development may leak ahead of September, but that's what we know for now.</p>\n<p>An investor note from Apple analyst Jeff Pu <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/15/iphone-17-air-titanium-rumor/\">indicated</a> that the Air will have a titanium frame. If his reports are accurate, the lightweight smartphone will be the only entry in the iPhone 17 lineup to use that metal; the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to be made of aluminum, which is oddly a lighter material than titanium. Other speculation had suggested that the Air would use a blend of aluminum and titanium, so the exact materials may not be known until the official announcement.</p>\n<p>Additionally, an August 4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/04/iphone-17-air-battery-half-thickness-17-pro/\"><em>MacRumors </em>report</a> says the internal battery pack of the iPhone Air is just 2.49mm thick — half the thickness of the iPhone 17 Pro battery. The leak was posted on the <a href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=223958615195&amp;navType=by\">Korean-language Naver blog</a>, where they show the alleged batteries of the iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro side by side. The same account claimed the 17 Air's battery capacity was a mere 2,800 mAh, <em>MacRumors</em> notes. (That's below the battery capacity of current iPhone 16 models.)</p>\n<p>A recent rumor from Majin Bu, whom <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/11/iphone-17-pro-antenna-rumor/\"><em>MacRumors </em></a>classifies as a &quot;hit-or-miss leaker,&quot; suggests the iPhone 17 Pro will have better wireless signal strength thanks to an updated antenna design. The individual <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1954890746693312762\">posted a render on X</a> that shows a new antenna system that wraps around the iPhone 17 Pro's supposedly wider rear camera bump. Again, this is a render, not a real-world photo. That said, we can't knock the goal of better wireless reception, so we're hoping this one has a degree of truth to it.</p>\n<p>Each new roster includes a base model, but over the years, Apple has shaken up the variety of phones it offers. Most likely there will be an iPhone 17 and an iPhone 17 Pro. Apple has also committed to the size matters philosophy, and has been building an iPhone Pro Max option with an even bigger screen and better battery life; the 17 roster will almost certainly have one as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new Pro iPhones are said to have a full-width &quot;camera island&quot; on the rear, which would mark the first time an Apple model opted for that design. This feature can be seen in the <a href=\"https://x.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057\">purported iPhone 17 &quot;spotted in the wild.&quot;</a> The pics, highlighted on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/07/28/iphone-17-pro-possibly-spotted-in-the-wild/\"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, show a black cased iPhone (17 Pro?) with the distinct back panel. Is it the real deal? The dual angles lend a degree of credibility in a social media landscape increasingly polluted with AI-enhanced fakes, but your guess is as good as ours.</p>\n<div id=\"a462ba8164d54c5a8ac8626b1540fe2f\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I just spotted a test development iPhone in the wild 🤩🤩🤩 <a href=\"https://t.co/iS3PtKWqxJ\">pic.twitter.com/iS3PtKWqxJ</a></p>— Fox Pupy 🦊🧡 (@Skyfops) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Skyfops/status/1949936265232888057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 28, 2025</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>The iPhone 17 Air seems primed to take the place of a potential iPhone 17 Plus. Since the iPhone 16e was only just introduced in February at <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html\">a surprisingly high price point</a>, it seems unlikely that there will be a new addition to that lower end of the spectrum, the models that were previously called SE.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At the very least, it sounds like the iPhone 17 Air won't take away the charging port and rely only on wireless connectivity. <em>Bloomberg</em> said that while Apple had investigated making the iPhone 17 Air without a single port, the company (fortunately) changed plans. He also says that the rumored phone will have a 6.6-inch screen and include the Dynamic Island and Camera Control button. Finally, the price is rumored at $900 — likely more than the standard iPhone 17 but less than the Pro.</p>\n<p>We've also gotten what seems to be a reliable look at what the color lineup will be for the new smartphones. <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2849423/iphone-17-colors-confirmed-see-all-of-apples-2026-options-right-here.html\"><em>Macworld</em></a> reported that the iPhone 17 will be available in black, white, steel gray, green, purple and light blue. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly have four color options: black, white, light blue and light gold. While the Air colors will be less saturated, the visuals for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will go bold. The options for the Pro models are expected to be black, white, gray, dark blue and orange.</p>\n<p>On July 30, <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/iphone-17-dummies-just-leaked-in-all-colors-and-theres-a-bold-new-signature-hue\"><em>Tom's Guide</em></a> highlighted an X post from <a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1950325609957380405\">Sonny Dickson</a> — a longtime and generally reliable leaker of unreleased iPhone information — showing &quot;dummy&quot; iPhone 17 models in the new colors that were the source of the aforementioned <em>Macworld</em> story. While these are literally just mock-ups — not real, leaked iPhones — it's interesting to see how the design and color rumors translate into a real-world look and feel.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-new-ios-be-like\">What will iOS 26 be like?</h2>\n<p>Apple upended its numbering conventions with WWDC 2025, and will match the name of each new operating system to the year it's released. So when the next wave of iPhones hits, they'll be running on <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-ios-26-public-beta-is-live-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-features-and-how-to-use-them-135749325.html\">iOS 26</a>.</p>\n<p>On the design side, the smartphone OS introduced during the big developer showcase took a contentious approach dubbed Liquid Glass. Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-read-your-mean-tweets-about-liquid-glass-and-finder-222230726.html\">scaling down</a> the amount of transparency effects in the subsequent beta tests of iOS 26, but it will still have a glass-like visual.</p>\n<p>The feature list includes big and small updates. On the more impactful side, the Phone and Photos apps have been redesigned. There will be several features leveraging artificial intelligence, such as live translation capabilities coming to Phone, FaceTime and Messages. Apple is also currently testing a sensitive content warning for child accounts that will <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-can-freeze-your-facetime-video-if-it-detects-nudity-135329941.html\">freeze FaceTime video</a> if nudity is detected by on-device machine learning tools. And the company is also launching Visual Intelligence, which will use AI to search for elements in an image.</p>\n<p>iOS 26 also has a litany of minor, quality of life improvements. Group texts are getting support for polls. And for the slow risers out there, iOS 26 will finally let you escape the tyranny of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-will-at-long-last-let-you-customize-snooze-times-on-alarms-in-ios-26-190001600.html\">nine minute snooze alarm</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next iOS is now available as a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/how-to-install-the-ios-18-public-beta-202938588.html\">public beta</a>. Here are our initial impressions of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">Liquid Glass design</a> and other new features. <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-released-ios-26-public-beta-heres-the-list-of-compatible-iphones-that-can-download-it-today-191854620.html\">iOS 26 is compatible</a> with all models back through iPhone 11.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-other-products-are-expected-to-be-released-alongside-the-iphone-17\">What other products are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17?</h2>\n<p>If Apple follows its usual pattern, the iPhone 17 will be announced alongside new Apple Watch products. That would be the Apple Watch Series 11 (if Apple sticks to the same naming scheme), and maybe an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and/or an updated Apple Watch SE. (They'll all run <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html\">watchOS 26</a>, of course.)</p>\n<p>Other possibilities — and this is, again, speculation — could include refreshed Apple AirPods Pro (which received its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-review-second-generation-130048218-130048292.html\">last big update in 2022</a>) and maybe new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apples-next-airtag-is-coming-in-2025-with-privacy-improvements-173028439.html\">AirTags trackers</a> (first released in 2021).</p>\n<p>But knowing Apple doesn't like to take the spotlight off its star performer — the iPhone — those accessories could come sometime later in the year (if they appear this year at all). The same goes for rumored refreshes of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/new-apple-tv-coming-later-this-year-with-a17-pro-chip/\">Apple TV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/homepod-mini-new-chip/\">HomePod mini</a>, which are also getting long in the tooth.</p>\n<p>Don't expect any Macs or iPads, however. Apple has recently been holding computer updates for late October (as it did last year with the new <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/everything-apple-announced-during-its-unofficial-mac-week-210115997.html\">M4 Macs</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August, 13, 2025, 10:02PM ET:</strong> Added a list of the products that are expected to be released alongside the iPhone 17s.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 11, 2025, 7:27PM ET:</strong> Added a render of a rumored new antenna design for the iPhone 17 Pro.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 8, 2025, 4:43PM ET:</strong> Added new speculation and reports about iPhone 17 pricing.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 6, 2025, 4:05PM ET:</strong> Added latest details about the potential iPhone 17 event date.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 4, 2025, 5:23PM ET:</strong> Added latest battery leaks about the iPhone 17 models.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, August 1, 2025, 8:15AM ET:</strong> Added new photos showing potential iPhone 17 colors.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, July 30, 2025, 11:08AM ET:</strong> Added latest leaks and rumors about the iPhone 17, and updated information on the iOS 26 public beta.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, July 17, 2025, 4:40PM ET:</strong> Added latest information about iOS 26, possible materials for the Air, and the color options for the different models.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, March 17, 2025, 2PM ET:</strong> Added details about the rumored price and features of the iPhone 17 Air.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, April 11, 2025, 3:45PM ET: </strong>Added details from Front Page Tech's new video that claims to reveal details from a leaked iOS 19 build.</p>\n<p><em>Katie Teague contributed to this story.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-release-is-rumored-for-september-everything-you-need-to-know-ahead-of-the-apple-fall-event-153024317.html?src=rss",

We spent two weeks test-driving it — you can check out our detailed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">hands-on iOS 26 preview</a>, or you can try it out yourself by <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-install-the-ios-26-public-beta-171117199.html\">downloading and installing the public beta 2</a>. That software is a more stable iteration of the separate developer version, which recently hit the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes\">beta 6</a> waypoint, and offers a few more <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/ios-26-beta-5-features/\">flashy features</a> not yet available in the public version. (While the public beta is open to everyone and quite stable, always remember there's a degree of risk involved with beta software.) Additionally, there are credible reports that iOS 26 could bring a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/apples-rumored-live-translation-feature-for-airpods-could-be-coming-with-ios-26-152715034.html\">new live translation feature to AirPods</a>, too. Not ready to upgrade your smartphone or tablet this year? No worries, we'll help you find out if your devices will be able to run iOS 26.</p>\n<p>While Apple didn't nix any iPhones from its eligibility list last year, that's not the case for 2025 — a few models are getting cut this time. All iPhone 8 models and the iPhone X were the last to get the boot in 2023, and this year the 2018 models are getting left behind. If you have an ineligible device, you won't be able to download iOS 26 when it becomes available this fall.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>We'll get to the bottom of which iPhones and iPads will support iOS 26 and iPadOS 26 this year.

You'll also notice buttons with a new floating design. Liquid Glass was designed to make all of Apple's OSes more cohesive.</p>\n<p><strong>Phone app redesign:</strong> You'll finally be able to scroll through contacts, recent calls and voicemail messages all on one screen. It also comes with a new feature called Hold Assist that'll notify you when an agent comes to the phone so you can avoid the elevator music.</p>\n<p><strong>Live Translate:</strong> iOS 26 is bringing the ability to have a conversation via phone call or text message with someone who speaks another language. Live Translate will translate your conversation in real time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Polls feature:</strong> Coming to group messages in the Messages app, chat members will be able to create polls. This can help prevent the unwanted 30+ messages when it comes to deciding which restaurant you're meeting at this weekend.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ready-for-apples-ios-26-these-are-all-the-compatible-iphones-that-can-run-public-beta-2-right-now-191854071.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "<p>Apple is still hard at work on becoming a relevant player in AI. The latest missive from Mark Gurman at <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-13/apple-s-ai-turnaround-plan-robots-lifelike-siri-and-home-security-cameras?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTEwOTEwMywiZXhwIjoxNzU1NzEzOTAzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVFUTUJEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJDNEVEQ0FFMUZBMDU0MEJFQTI0QTlGMjExQzFFOTA4MCJ9.Il6BVwyG-o8dn5FlzCjjc0tY-NekpR_qR0QDfjSXNjw&amp;embedded-checkout=true\"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> suggests that Apple is shifting its artificial intelligence goals to center on new device segments. Sources reportedly told the publication that Apple has a slate of new smart home products in the works that could help pivot its lagging AI strategy.</p>\n<p>The center of the new lineup is a tabletop AI companion that has been described as an iPad on a movable robotic arm. It would be able to swivel to face the screen toward a user as they move around their home or office. Sources said the current prototype uses a horizontal display that's about seven inches while the motorized arm can move the screen about six inches away from the base in any direction. Equipped with a <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-updated-siri-that-interacts-with-apps-reportedly-wont-be-here-until-next-spring-183000378.html\"><ins>long-promised overhaul</ins></a> to the Siri voice assistant, this device could act like an additional person, recalling information, making suggestions and participating in conversations. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple is targeting a 2027 release for this product.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Apple's new lineup is also rumored to include a smart home hub that is a simpler version of the robotic friend with no moving stand. We might be seeing this sooner, with a projected 2026 release for the device. This hub device would be able to control music playback, take notes, browse the web and host videoconferencing. Both the robot companion and the smart home hub are reportedly running a new operating system called Charismatic that's designed to support multiple users. The Siri running on the device will be given a particularly cheery personality, and it may also be getting a visual representation. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s sources said there hasn't been a final decision on aesthetics; internal tests have had Siri looking like an animated Finder icon and like a Memoji.</p>\n<p>Today's scuttlebutt follows on previous reports from Gurman that pointed to Apple's interest in these categories. The idea of a smart home hub was apparently floated at the company as far back as 2022, and it's finally being <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/apples-smart-home-hub-could-reportedly-make-its-debut-later-this-year-161702487.html\"><ins>rumored</ins></a> to have a formal debut some time this year. Robots have also been a topic of interest in Cupertino for some time, with claims that Apple was developing a personal robot dating back <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-is-developing-personal-robots-for-your-home-bloomberg-says-044254029.html\"><ins>at least to last spring</ins></a>. While this <em>Bloomberg</em> piece offers more detail about those hypothetical plans, there's always a chance Apple will change direction or scrap a project.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-tabletop-robot-companion-rumored-for-2027-launch-204904807.html?src=rss",

Chibi-Robo’s helpfulness isn’t limited to humans, though. In its quest to spread happiness, it also assists several animals and even enchanted toys along the way. As a player, you have to keep an eye on the robot’s battery life and use power outlets dotted around the house to recharge it. Fail to do so and it’ll collapse, and you’ll lose a chunk of the in-game currency you’ve collected.</p>\n<p><em>Chibi-Robo! </em>looks like a typically charming Nintendo game in every respect, but it was actually originally conceived by now-defunct developer Skip Ltd. as a point-and-click adventure game, with Bandai as the publisher. Exactly how or why the game ended up moving over to Nintendo remains a mystery, but director Kenichi Nishi told <a href=\"https://www.timeextension.com/features/the-making-of-chibi-robo-how-miyamoto-saved-a-cult-hit-from-the-scrapheap\"><em>Time Extension</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that<em>&nbsp;</em>Shigeru Miyamoto took a particular liking to the character design.

      "summary": "<p>One thing I need to make clear right from the start: this is a review of Norton VPN (formerly Norton Secure VPN, and briefly Norton Ultra VPN) as a standalone app, not of the VPN feature in the Norton 360 package. They're similar, but Norton VPN has a few more features, including the ability to choose cities as server locations in countries with more than one option.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I'll state my opinion up front. Norton VPN isn't a bad service, but it's not good enough to get ahead of its direct competitors. ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN and NordVPN are all either faster, more feature-rich, more secure, more affordable or some combination of the four. There's no reason to go with Norton as your VPN unless you're getting it as part of another Norton 360 bundle.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">For this review, I ran rigorous tests that highlighted Norton VPN's strengths (well-designed user interfaces, a verified privacy policy) along with its weaknesses (holes in its security, renewals that double the price, weak customer support). Norton's history of focusing on Windows means that app is by far the most complete; if you're on any other platform, expect to miss out on the best VPN protocols and the complete feature set.</p> \n<p><em>Editors' note: We're in the process of rebooting all of our VPN reviews from scratch.

Its apps for Windows, Mac, Android, iOS and browsers are all similar, but there are distinctions in both design and features.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-windows\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Windows</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Once you download the Norton VPN app from its website or the Microsoft Store, an installation wizard takes over and makes the rest of the process easy. You'll have to click to grant a few permissions and skip through a tutorial, but after that, you're free to move about the interface.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"windows app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d66b31-748b-11f0-9e7f-c069cac1ac32\" style=\"height: 3000px; width: 4000px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's Windows UI was a pleasant surprise. There's no wasted detail on the front page. Click the large yellow button to connect to the VPN, or select the server name to go to the location list, which is alphabetized. Clicking the very first entry in the list connects you to the fastest location. IP rotator servers and double VPN routes are grouped under tabs below that. There's no clutter and no aggressive popups, and connections happen quickly.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">You'll find four tabs on the left-hand side of the Window. The top one manages the VPN. Then there's a store for other Norton products (IMO the only real misstep), a set of help pages and the controls for the VPN's settings and features. This last is subdivided into a row of easily understandable subtabs. I'm impressed by how seamlessly the design works in explanations of what each setting does — it makes the whole thing that much more accessible.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-mac\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Mac</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Downloading Norton VPN for Mac is a quick and painless process, with one slight difference from Windows: you'll have to mess around a bit in System Preferences to give Norton the permissions it needs. Fortunately, the setup wizard guides you through the steps with text and animations.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"mac app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f16d40-748b-11f0-be3f-ce92971cfe97\" style=\"height: 3000px; width: 4000px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The actual interface is just as free of clutter as the Windows app — more so in some cases, as there's no shilling of the rest of the Norton family. The downside is that there's also no help center access from the main window; you have to go to Settings -&gt; Troubleshooting to find the link. There also aren't links to specific help articles like the Windows app includes.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-android\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Android</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">One word of warning about Norton VPN's mobile apps: you need an internet connection for the initial login and setup. It doesn't appear to be opening a website, but if you don't have web access, you'll get stuck in an endless loading loop.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The front pages of Norton VPN's desktop apps don't have many design elements, so the same general schematic is easy to compress onto mobile. The Android client has a status indicator, a large button to start your connection, tabs along the bottom and a gear icon for settings in the top-right. It's all intuitive and responsive.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"android app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f16d41-748b-11f0-bfda-2c3032eedba3\" style=\"height: 2340px; width: 1080px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">If I were to change anything, though, I'd take some of the options from the upper-right settings menu and swap them with the bottom tabs for notifications and accounts settings. VPN preferences should be accessible in one click, especially protocols. Frankly, the messages you get from this app aren't important enough to merit such pride of place.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-ios\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">iOS</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's apps for iPhone and iPad are almost identical to its Android app. The only real difference is that the iOS client is missing some features, most notably split tunneling; also, the kill switch is only available on the Mimic protocol, about which there's limited information. Other than that, it feels good to use. While it's not great that Apple users lose out on the full feature set, I can't deny it alleviates the problem of the VPN preferences menu feeling overstuffed.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"ios app norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f14630-748b-11f0-9eed-b254e6e8fcb7\" style=\"height: 1334px; width: 750px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-browser-extensions\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Browser extensions</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN has browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox and Edge. The only reason to install any of these is to access the ad blocker, which doesn't come with either of the desktop apps. Other than that, it's an underwhelming extension. I recommend skipping it and going with a dedicated ad blocker instead — you'll get more customization features that way.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"chrome extension norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d66b30-748b-11f0-afef-63aa18aeb9ab\" style=\"height: 1112px; width: 843px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-speed-test\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN speed test</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Using speedtest.net, I tested Norton VPN to see how much it slowed down my browsing speeds. I then calculated the results as percentages. While different networks give you different starting speeds, the same server location tends to slow down all those networks at about the same rate. You can use this table to estimate how much speed you can expect while Norton VPN is running.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">As a reference, you generally need download speed for loading web pages and videos, upload speed for sending large amounts of data and latency for real-time communication. Latency always increases sharply over longer distances, but a good VPN can still keep the jumps under control. Let's see how Norton VPN did.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Server location</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Latency (ms)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Increase factor</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Download speed (Mbps)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Percentage drop</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Upload speed (Mbps)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Percentage drop</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Portland, OR, USA (unprotected)</p> </td> \n   <td><p>18</p> </td> \n   <td><p>—</p> </td> \n   <td><p>58.90</p> </td> \n   <td><p>—</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.91</p> </td> \n   <td><p>—</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Portland, OR, USA (protected)</p> </td> \n   <td><p>30</p> </td> \n   <td><p>1.7x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>55.83</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.53</p> </td> \n   <td><p>6.4</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>McAllen, TX, USA</p> </td> \n   <td><p>164</p> </td> \n   <td><p>9.1x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>48.96</p> </td> \n   <td><p>16.9</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.70</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3.6</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Argentina</p> </td> \n   <td><p>422</p> </td> \n   <td><p>23.4x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>43.02</p> </td> \n   <td><p>27.0</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.72</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3.2</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Croatia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>379</p> </td> \n   <td><p>21.1x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>46.35</p> </td> \n   <td><p>21.3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.65</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4.4</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Nigeria</p> </td> \n   <td><p>564</p> </td> \n   <td><p>31.3x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>39.94</p> </td> \n   <td><p>32.2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3.86</p> </td> \n   <td><p>34.7</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Indonesia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>375</p> </td> \n   <td><p>20.8x</p> </td> \n   <td><p>44.88</p> </td> \n   <td><p>23.8</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5.64</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4.6</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Average</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>322</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>17.9x</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>46.50</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>21.1</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>5.35</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>9.5</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Before I interpret the results, I should mention that the algorithm Norton VPN uses to pick the fastest server doesn't seem to be reliable. Every time I clicked it, it gave me the server in Texas, thousands of miles from my real location in Portland, Oregon. Moreover, the Portland server was obviously faster. This happened repeatedly over multiple days of testing.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">To the point: this table doesn't look good for Norton VPN. Download speeds dropped an average of 21.1 percent, the worst showing of any VPN I've tested so far. What's worse, the data clearly trend toward worse speeds at greater distances. Although it's true that distance impacts download speed as well as latency, it's also true that a well-implemented modern server OS should be able to render that effect minimal.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"speed test norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e27921-748b-11f0-8b67-d4fd7b70bbb8\" style=\"height: 1344px; width: 3032px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Upload speed looks better, with an average drop of under 10 percent — mainly dragged down by the Nigeria server, which cut speeds sharply across every test. Latency is also not awful. Controlling for the expected variance due to distance, Norton VPN beat out both Surfshark and NordVPN in average worldwide ping, which suggests that gaming may be its comfort zone.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-security-test\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN security test</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A VPN's primary job is to change your IP address. While doing this, it must also encrypt your communications with its servers so nobody can follow your connection home — this is what separates a VPN from a simple proxy. In this section, I'll run three checks to see whether Norton VPN can guarantee anonymous browsing.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-vpn-protocols\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">VPN protocols</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">VPNs use protocols to establish stable connections between your devices and their servers. Most providers pick from the same pool of field-tested options, but you do see a surprise every now and then, like Norton VPN's Mimic.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's protocol selection follows its general trend of serving very different experiences to users on different platforms. Windows and Android users get WireGuard, OpenVPN and Mimic, while macOS and iOS users only get Mimic and IKEv2. Here's a rundown of each.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>WireGuard </strong>is the most modern open-source VPN protocol currently available. It's almost always the fastest and uses a secure stream cipher for cryptography. The one downside is that it saves your real IP address to keep the connection open. Norton VPN deals with this by assigning temporary dynamic IP addresses during the authentication process.</p></li> \n <li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong>OpenVPN </strong>is an open source protocol that's been in use for ages. Its source code is slightly clunky after years of volunteers poking it for weaknesses, but that also makes it the most trustworthy option. It's fast on average, though usually slower than WireGuard or IKEv2.</p></li> \n <li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><strong>IKEv2 </strong>is a fast protocol that's good at reconnecting mobile devices as they move between networks. Norton VPN uses it in conjunction with IPSec encryption. If you're on an Apple device, it's your only option other than Mimic.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Mimic </strong>is an obfuscation protocol, which makes your VPN connection look like regular HTTPS traffic. This can get around networks that block all VPN traffic regardless of content. Mimic is based on TLS 1.3, and uses the same standard encryption algorithms as the other protocols.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Normally, I advise letting your VPN choose what protocol is best. Norton VPN is different. There simply isn't enough information about Mimic for me to trust it, and you shouldn't let the VPN switch you to it without your knowledge. All the others are fine, though.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-leak-test\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Leak test</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Testing a VPN for leaks is easy: just check your IP address before and after connecting, and see if it changes. I used IPleak.net to run that test on several Norton VPN servers. I first observed that Norton VPN prevents IPv6 leaks by blocking IPv6 altogether. On every run, the IPv6 test failed to load, no matter which server location I chose. This is an effective way to make leaks impossible, since almost none of the internet is IPv6-only yet.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"ipv6 blocked norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e27920-748b-11f0-bedf-852a8f72e847\" style=\"height: 1353px; width: 3246px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">My second conclusion was that Norton VPN's servers don't leak through DNS or WebRTC while your connection remains stable. However, every time I changed from one location to another, my real IP address was visible on the test screen for several seconds. Enabling the kill switch solved this problem, but the kill switch is not active by default, so make sure you turn it on in the settings.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"dns leak norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e167b0-748b-11f0-9fbb-2bb34c6d9ad9\" style=\"height: 1380px; width: 2777px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">There is one other serious problem with this: on the iOS app, the kill switch cannot be used except with the Mimic protocol. This forces users to choose between leaving a hole in their security or trusting it to a protocol with limited transparency. Until this changes, I can't recommend installing Norton VPN on iOS at all.</p> \n<p>I tested the rotating IP server in the United States to see if it had the same problem, and thankfully didn't notice it. A Norton representative also confirmed that all servers have their own DNS resolvers that avoid public servers, cutting off a big source of leaks. Still, I'd recommend keeping the kill switch engaged. As long as you remember this, Norton VPN is secure.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-encryption-test\">Encryption test</h3> \n<p>Finally, I ran a test with WireShark to see if Norton VPN's protocols managed to encrypt my traffic. Since I've been uncertain about Mimic, I used it for the encryption test. I found that Mimic does in fact encrypt data packets, even on an unsecured HTTP connection. WireShark also confirmed to me that Mimic is using TLS for key exchange and encryption.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"encryption test norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e2a030-748b-11f0-9e7f-e4ce2d807698\" style=\"height: 1164px; width: 3329px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-how-much-does-norton-vpn-cost\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">How much does Norton VPN cost?</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN subscriptions are only available for one year at a time — there's no monthly option. There are three different subscription tiers, summarized in the table below. \"Number of devices\" refers to how many devices you can have installed on a single account, whether or not any of them are connected to the VPN.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Subscription</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Starting price (One year)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Renewal price (One year)</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Number of devices</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Features</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Standard</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$39.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$79.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Basic VPN service, IP rotation, double VPN, kill switch</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Plus</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$49.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$109.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Antivirus, password manager, dark web alerts, 10GB cloud backup</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Ultimate</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$59.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>$129.99</p> </td> \n   <td><p>10</p> </td> \n   <td><p>Parental controls, device locator</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The Standard subscription is a reasonable price for what you get, but the superior Proton VPN is barely more expensive and Surfshark is actually cheaper. In other words, Norton VPN is a good price, but not great value — especially when you factor in the renewal prices, all of which force you to pay double or more what you paid the first time. If you'd like to decide for yourself, all the plans do come with a 60-day money-back guarantee.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-side-apps-and-bundles\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN side apps and bundles</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton is better known as an antivirus company than a VPN provider, so naturally Norton VPN is packaged with the rest of the Norton 360 family. Be warned — unless you turn the option off in the Settings -&gt; Privacy tab, Norton will collect information on your app usage and use it to target you with ads for its other products.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton 360 is a massive product line encompassing dozens of individual subscriptions. To keep this section from bloating, I'll focus on the software available as part of an upgraded Norton VPN subscription, then end by listing the Norton 360 plans that include Norton VPN.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-features-on-norton-vpn-plus\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Features on Norton VPN Plus</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A Norton VPN Plus subscription adds several features from Norton's antivirus suite, but isn't a complete replacement for Norton or any other dedicated antivirus software. Plus users get most of the antivirus features that work in real time, including a smart firewall, anti-ransomware backups, a sandbox for quarantining suspicious programs and a malicious script blocker.</p> \n<p>VPN subscribers do not get access to the quicker Smart Scan option, instead getting a different scan feature that checks for online threats (note that the <a href=\"https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v20240726114723559\">FAQ page</a> about this erroneously says Norton VPN includes Smart Scan). VPN users also miss out on the LiveUpdate feature that installs security patches autonomously, plus the automated hard drive cleaner.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-features-on-norton-vpn-ultimate\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Features on Norton VPN Ultimate</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">In addition to raising the device limit to 10, Norton VPN Ultimate adds two features on top of Plus: parental controls and Privacy Monitor. The latter is only available in the US and Canada.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Parental control is both a time-based site blocker and a monitoring app. It can not only track a child's internet activity, but also their physical location, giving you alerts if they leave set boundaries during a certain time (say school property during a weekday). Privacy Monitor scans for your information on data brokerage sites so you can send deletion requests, similar to Surfshark Incogni.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-360-plans-that-include-norton-vpn\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Norton 360 plans that include Norton VPN</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Instead of subscribing to Norton VPN directly, you can also pick a Norton 360 plan that includes VPN service. Norton 360 Standard and Norton 360 For Gamers each let you install Norton VPN on three devices. Norton 360 Deluxe raises that number to five, while Norton 360 with Lifelock Select and Norton 360 with Lifelock Advantage grant you 10 total VPN installs. Norton 360 with Lifelock Ultimate Plus lets you install Norton VPN on an unlimited number of devices.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-close-reading-norton-vpns-privacy-policy\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Close-reading Norton VPN's privacy policy</h2> \n<p>To assess Norton VPN's privacy, we need to look at two different privacy policies. Like I said in the introduction, there are technically two products called Norton VPN — the standalone service I've been reviewing and the VPN features of the Norton 360 bundle. I've been focused on the independent Norton VPN so far, but since the Norton 360 VPN add-on is a privacy risk, I want to mention it here.</p> \n<p>Norton lists the privacy policies for each of its products <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9a9a32a1-c506-4077-9db1-d8922d34d6e3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=on+one+page&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJpdmFjeS9wcm9kdWN0cy1wcml2YWN5LW5vdGljZSIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOWE5YTMyYTEtYzUwNi00MDc3LTlkYjEtZDg5MjJkMzRkNmUzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vcHJpdmFjeS9wcm9kdWN0cy1wcml2YWN5LW5vdGljZSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAdfybE3QXdIAEk4MrKsD0ivrDzcCR8tdiV_Nh_kvQ_dW&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Fprivacy%2Fproducts-privacy-notice\">on one page</a> of its website. The VPN feature of Norton 360 is governed by the top two policies, Norton Security Products (desktop) and Norton 360 Mobile Apps. The standalone Norton VPN has its own policy further down the page.</p> \n<p>The Norton 360 policy is a privacy nightmare. Both the desktop and mobile apps claim the right to save your IP address, device fingerprints and web activity for up to 36 months, and there's no exception for the VPN feature. I strongly advise against using Norton 360's bundled VPN for any activity you don't want Norton seeing.</p> \n<p>Fortunately, Norton holds the standalone VPN to a much more acceptable set of rules. It isn't permitted to collect IP addresses, browsing history or DNS requests, nor can it share any of the data it does collect with partners. The partners note is important because one of Norton's sibling companies, Avast, is known to have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-avast-jumpshot-selling-user-data.html\">sold information on its users</a> to corporations for ad targeting. A Norton representative stated that Avast is no longer involved in harvesting or selling user data. More importantly, he said that no data from VPN products is shared between Gen Digital brands.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-independent-privacy-audits\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Independent privacy audits</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A recent audit by penetration testing firm VerSprite provides reason to be hopeful about Norton VPN's privacy. According to a report published in August 2024, <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=02faf16c-8eea-4114-a20e-7db1c0f119c0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=9a9a32a1-c506-4077-9db1-d8922d34d6e3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Norton&amp;linkText=which+you+can+download+from+this+page&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3VzLm5vcnRvbi5jb20vZmVhdHVyZS9ub3J0b24tdnBuLW5vLWxvZy1wb2xpY3kiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjlhOWEzMmExLWM1MDYtNDA3Ny05ZGIxLWQ4OTIyZDM0ZDZlMyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly91cy5ub3J0b24uY29tL2ZlYXR1cmUvbm9ydG9uLXZwbi1uby1sb2ctcG9saWN5In0&amp;signature=AQAAAaB644obAjaQlco0Y5Uk1GrFOEoY3MPUSlTv0cYp-I2U&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Ffeature%2Fnorton-vpn-no-log-policy\">which you can download from this page</a>, VerSprite found that Norton VPN posed an overall \"low\" privacy risk, judged on a scale of low, medium, high and critical risks.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">During their audit, VerSprite informed Norton that certain conditions could make VPN users identifiable. In a second round of tests, Norton appears to have fixed those vulnerabilities. That's certainly reassuring, but I wish the report — which only runs three pages in all — was more specific about what the problem actually was. Regardless, the VerSprite audit is a good sign that Norton VPN is taking privacy more seriously than Norton as a whole.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-can-norton-vpn-change-your-virtual-location\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Can Norton VPN change your virtual location?</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">If a VPN can change your virtual location, it can not only throw ISPs and other interlopers off your real identity, but also change what you see on the internet — especially on streaming sites, where connecting through a different country can unlock new shows. However, Netflix and its brethren block VPN traffic for copyright reasons, so it's never a guarantee that you'll get in.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"netflix canada norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f14631-748b-11f0-bff7-08439abfd41b\" style=\"height: 1213px; width: 3165px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I tested Norton VPN's ability to unblock Netflix on five different locations, connecting three times on three different servers in each place. I set the app to automatically choose the protocol. In the table below, you'll see how many tests each location passed, and whether Netflix showed new content each time. If I get into Netflix but the library doesn't change, that indicates the server might be leaky.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Server location</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Unblocked Netflix?</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Changed content?</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Vancouver, Canada</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Iceland</p> </td> \n   <td><p>0/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>0/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Latvia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Morocco</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Philippines</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n   <td><p>3/3</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I had no problems in four out of five of the locations I tested, but Netflix utterly defeated the Iceland servers. No matter how many times I disconnected and reconnected to get a new IP address, Netflix recognized a VPN server and blocked me. This happened even when I switched to the Mimic protocol.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"iceland blocked norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91f16d42-748b-11f0-ba77-52e36d4c5e8b\" style=\"height: 1782px; width: 3282px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">That indicates that Netflix has blocklisted most or all of Norton VPN's servers in Iceland, and the company hasn't caught up. It's another troubling indication that Norton isn't committing the level of attention that its server network requires.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-investigating-norton-vpns-server-network\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Investigating Norton VPN's server network</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Speaking of the server network, now's the time to get deeper into it. The relative scarcity of different IP addresses on Norton VPN, along with the download speed drops over long distances, suggest to me that Norton might have relegated maintaining VPN data centers to an afterthought. So, let's see what its worldwide server selection looks like.</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p><strong>Region</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Countries with servers</strong></p> </td> \n   <td><p><strong>Total server locations</strong></p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>North America</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>32</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>South America</p> </td> \n   <td><p>6</p> </td> \n   <td><p>6</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Europe</p> </td> \n   <td><p>36</p> </td> \n   <td><p>47</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Africa</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n   <td><p>5</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Middle East</p> </td> \n   <td><p>2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>2</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Asia</p> </td> \n   <td><p>10</p> </td> \n   <td><p>10</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Oceania</p> </td> \n   <td><p>2</p> </td> \n   <td><p>4</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><p>Total</p> </td> \n   <td><p>66</p> </td> \n   <td><p>106</p> </td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>All of Norton VPN's server locations are physical, with no virtual locations. This makes its network more reliable — virtual server locations can deliver unexpected speed swings. However, it does limit the number of locations Norton is capable of offering.</p> \n<p>The selection is reasonably good, with many locations in often-underserved Africa and South America, and many options in marquee regions like the US and Europe. However, it's a pretty small network for what Norton is charging. Also, as we saw with the Iceland location getting blocked by Netflix, having a country on the menu doesn't necessarily mean it will do the job.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-extra-features-of-norton-vpn\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Extra features of Norton VPN</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN added a ton of features in the first several months of 2025. Most of these mainly brought it up to par with other VPNs, like city-level region selection or support for smart TVs. However, there are one or two you won't find in many other places, like the IP rotator — to my knowledge, nobody else has that except Surfshark. Here are the most important extras to know about.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-ad-blocker\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Ad blocker</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN's ad blocker can be used on its browser extension. Its mobile apps can block the trackers embedded in ads, but not the ads themselves. There's not a lot of customization potential; you can turn it on and off, and that's mainly it. The one option you have on the extension is to turn \"acceptable ads\" back on. This can help you get into sites that normally block users with adblock on, or use sites where you want to see ads to help them monetize.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Ad tracker blocker norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d35df0-748b-11f0-bff3-145cf60d58cb\" style=\"height: 2340px; width: 1080px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-double-vpn-and-ip-rotator\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Double VPN and IP rotator</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton introduced these two features in 2025 as \"enhanced anonymity\" upgrades. Double VPN runs your VPN through two server locations instead of one, so you're still safe if one server breaks down. You can choose from eight pre-determined multi-hop paths with endpoints in the USA, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Germany and Taiwan.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"double hop norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91e25210-748b-11f0-adbf-6a2dd84b8100\" style=\"height: 1345px; width: 2006px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">IP rotation servers change your IP address frequently while you're connected, which makes you harder to track. Unlike Surfshark, which lets you turn this on everywhere, Norton VPN limits you to six IP rotator locations: the USA, the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany and Australia.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-convenience-features\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Convenience features</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The next three features were also added in the last eight months. The server location menu now puts your last five locations at the top for easy retrieval. While connected to a server, you can pause the VPN for 15, 30 or 60 minutes, after which it turns back on. Finally, the mobile apps have added a home screen widget so you can operate the VPN without opening the app.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"pause connection norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d75590-748b-11f0-b37f-77b98e25959e\" style=\"height: 1344px; width: 2014px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-kill-switch\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Kill switch</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">A VPN kill switch cuts off your internet access if you lose your VPN connection, so any sensitive information isn't broadcast unprotected. Norton VPN's kill switch is vital, since it appears to briefly drop encryption while switching server locations. Unfortunately, it's not available on iOS.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-split-tunneling\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Split tunneling</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The Windows and Android apps for Norton VPN allow split tunneling, in which only certain apps go through the VPN while others connect directly. Norton uses app-based split tunneling, but if you want to protect or remove protection from specific URLs, you can use two different web browsers.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-wi-fi-security\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Wi-Fi security</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">This feature, which appears on NortonVPN's mobile apps only, activates whenever you connect to a Wi-Fi network. Norton VPN scans that network for common attacks launched over Wi-Fi, like DNS poisoning and SSL stripping, and sends you an alert if it detects any.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-p2p-optimization\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">P2P optimization</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Norton VPN has certain servers in its network configured for torrenting. You can't use it for torrenting outside those locations — if you try, the VPN will disconnect. To connect to a P2P server, just select \"P2P-optimized region\" from the server menu. You can't choose a torrenting server in a specific region; the app just selects the fastest.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-customer-support-options\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN customer support options</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Following the broad trend of Norton VPN, the Windows app gets most of the love, having much more in-app support than any other platform. Mac users get a troubleshooting tab in the settings menu, with three options: go to the online help center, send a bug report or go to the community forum. iOS and Android just have a \"help and support\" button on the accounts page that sends you straight to the website.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">On Windows, there's a separate help and support tab above the settings tab, which gives you direct links to some of the most important pages on the Norton website. It's also got links to the forum and help center. Then there's the same troubleshooting tab as the Mac app, but with more options. Windows users can reset the app to default, record a problem to get more specific help, send debug logs and run an automated \"Repair Norton\" process.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">If you got to the website through a desktop app, it's surprisingly difficult to get to the general support page for Norton VPN — Windows links to a splintered set of FAQ pages, while Mac sends you to a Mac-specific page for the entire Norton Family. I recommend just going to support.norton.com in your browser, then clicking the Norton VPN button. At least the links in both mobile apps take you straight there.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Once you have gotten to the Norton VPN support page, you won't find much of use. Help articles are limited and leave some big holes. For example, all connectivity problems are limited to a page called \"Fix problem accessing the internet when connected to Norton VPN.\" The only advice for Windows, Mac and Android is to choose a different VPN protocol, and there's nothing at all for iOS.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Even worse, whenever you use the search bar to look anything up, you're forced to watch an AI answer type itself out in real time, so links to the actual help pages are constantly jumping around as you try to click on them. It's this feature that pushes Norton's help pages from negligent to hostile.</p> \n<h3 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-live-support-experience\" style=\"margin-top: 16pt; margin-bottom: 4pt;\">Live support experience</h3> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">There are a few other ways to get support from Norton VPN. You can check in on the community forum, chat live with an agent or call their phone line. The forums are reasonably active for Windows, but pretty dead for all other platforms.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I used live chat to ask about a problem with installing the iOS app. I managed to reach a human pretty quickly, but there were several long pauses during our conversation. Eventually, they escalated my case to a higher support team.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"live chat norton vpn\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91d66b30-748b-11f0-bdff-1b3d4d888c6f\" style=\"height: 1753px; width: 2963px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Sam Chapman for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">I assumed that this team would send me an email, per standard practice. Instead, they repeatedly tried to reach me by phone. I was not warned that they would do this, and each time, the call was flagged as spam. By the time I realized Norton was calling me, I'd already solved the problem myself. Be aware of this if you plan to contact Norton with a difficult issue.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-norton-vpn-background-check\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Norton VPN background check</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">The Norton software brand has existed in some form or another since the Norton Utilities package was developed for DOS in 1982. The brand was acquired in 1990 by Symantec, which had published its own first antivirus program the year before. Symantec began releasing Norton Antivirus in 1991, and continued distributing it until its merger with Avast in 2022. Since then, the combined company has been called Gen Digital.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Compared to that long history, Norton VPN has only been around for a blip. It <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/norton-adds-a-vpn-and-more-to-its-refreshed-360-products\">launched in 2019</a> as part of Symantec's bid to expand the Norton Antivirus line into a suite that could defend against more types of threats. As such, while Norton and Symantec have been involved in their share of controversies over the years, very few of them happened during Norton VPN's lifetime.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Despite Norton's long and checkered history, checking the background of its VPN is pretty simple: nothing has gone seriously wrong yet. This VPN has problems, but they're mainly out in the open, stemming from it being a relative afterthought from a company more focused on other types of security.</p> \n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"jump-link-final-verdict\" style=\"margin-top: 18pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;\">Final verdict</h2> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">For me to recommend a VPN, it has to stand out in a crowded field. After a week of working with Norton VPN, I have to conclude that the only way it distinguishes itself is the Norton name. For everything else it does, a competitor does it better. Surfshark scoops it on IP rotation and multihop, ExpressVPN has better protocols, NordVPN is faster and Proton VPN's ad blocker works in more places.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">One thing I will say in Norton VPN's favor is that it's working to rectify all this. In the last year, it's added a lot of features. The problem is that most of those are options I'd have expected it to have already, such as city-level region selection and a kill switch on Mac. It's catching up, not innovating.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">It's also nice that you can use the bundles to roll more Norton products into one subscription. However, since Norton is much more experienced at developing other sorts of security software, I'd advise going the Norton 360 route if you're interested in those other features and treating the VPN as an add-on. Norton VPN is a side dish, not an entree.</p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/norton-vpn-review-a-vpn-that-fails-to-meet-nortons-standards-170037086.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "<p><em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> is finally ready to ditch last-gen consoles. On Wednesday, the developer <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://pubg.com/en/news/9005\">said</a> that the game will transition to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S on November 13.</p>\n<p>Although the battle royale has been playable on current-gen consoles all along, it was running as a PS4 or Xbox One game. That helped it cast a wide net (and probably make more money), but it also came with technical limitations. The company said the move to current-gen will &quot;provide our players with a more stable gameplay environment on console and ensure a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>PS5 players can expect the new version to play in 1440p at 60fps. Both the PS5 Pro and Xbox Series X will reach 2160p at 60fps. However, the two high-end systems will support Dynamic 4K resolution. Meanwhile, the Xbox Series S will run at 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps. (Your choice.)</p>\n<p>Here's how <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> currently looks on PS5.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Screenshot of PUBG on PS5 before an upcoming update.

PlayStation users will need to download a separate PS5 version of the game on November 13. If you already have it installed on your Xbox Series X/S, the current-gen update will install automatically via <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-24-xbox-series-x-gpu-specs.html\">Microsoft's Smart Delivery</a>. On both systems, your existing account data and purchased items will transition automatically.</p>\n<p>PUBG left its last-gen users a sentimental message that sounds a bit like a corporate layoff letter. &quot;We still vividly remember the epic battles, the heart-stopping moments, and the camaraderie that brought us together,&quot; the company wrote. &quot;We are deeply grateful for every moment you've spent with us over the past eight years.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pubg-battlegrounds-will-leave-ps4-and-xbox-one-behind-later-this-year-162932937.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "<p>Since the original <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/tamagotchi/\">Tamagotchi</a> landed on store shelves 28 years ago, not much has changed in the world of virtual pets. The basic gameplay remains, with players being asked to feed, groom and play with small digital creatures inside a handheld device. But new features have also been added, like Bluetooth connectivity and downloadable content (they're also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/heres-the-absolutely-massive-tamagotchi-paradise-next-to-other-objects-in-the-wild-for-scale-172017149.html\">a little bigger</a> than before). This month, however, Hasbro is throwing its hat into the ring with the Nano-Mals, a $20 device that takes the standard features of a virtual pet and aims them toward a new purpose: fidget toy.</p> \n<p>The first thing you’ll probably notice when you pick up one of the eight initial Nano-Mals models is how cute they all are: they’re styled after both common and uncommon animals, including two cows, two cats, a red panda, a narwhal, and a pair of unicorns.But the second thing you’ll notice is that there’s no screen to be found anywhere; instead, the sole “display” is a a light-up heart on the front of the toy that has three levels and changes color to indicate how satiated the toy is in terms of hunger, affection and play.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>How you fulfill these needs is where the Nano-mals distinguish themselves from other virtual pets: Instead of pushing buttons and navigating through various menus, you interact instead with the various parts of the toy directly. Push down on its ear to “pet” it, flip its arms to “dance” and push its nose to “feed” it. The more you perform these actions, the more each color of the heart will fill up, eventually resulting in a rainbow kaleidoscope across the toy’s chest.</p> \n<p>It’s incredibly easy to do, not just because these are simple actions, but because they’re engineered to be satisfying since it is a fidget toy. It feels good to flip the arms up and down and squish the ears. Not so much for pushing the shallow nose button though, meaning it was often the need that took the longest for me to fulfill. It just wasn’t fun to push the nose! I can only hope that future iterations improve on this.</p> \n<p>Once you’ve figured out the basic functions, it becomes a game in itself to figure out the best way to hold and interact with the device. You don’t need to look at it and the entire thing can be operated with one hand, which is exactly what you want in a fidget toy. I found myself rotating it between my fingers while flipping the arms – the device also contains an accelerometer so any significant movement also counts as “play.”</p> \n<p>If you have more than one Nano-mal – which is quite likely given the device’s low price – the toys will interact with each other, lighting up and talking to each other. It’s cute but also a bit unsettling, as it was very reminiscent of this year’s Black Mirror episode “Playthings” with the Nano-mals emitting mysterious bleats and chimes just like the Thronglets. Fortunately, there is an off switch, and the Nano-mals will burble happily before shutting down when you use it.</p> \n<figure> \n <img alt=\"Hands-on photo of Hasboro's Nano-Mals fidget toys.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/29b27680-784a-11f0-bfc7-47b0ec963810\" style=\"height: 2268px; width: 4032px;\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n   Kris Naudus for Engadget \n </div> \n</figure> \n<p>However, the off switch isn’t absolute as, should you press any of the buttons, the Nano-mal will still react, though maybe not effusively as if the device were powered fully on. This is a problem given that the Nano-mal is meant to be taken out and about (there’s even a clip at the top), but will likely be banned from classrooms due to the possibility of it being accidentally triggered when a kid moves their stuff. The toys can be muted by holding down the nose for a few seconds, but it only works when the device is fully powered on, and resets every time the Nano-mal is turned off and on.</p> \n<p>Aside from that and the fact that I couldn’t remove the attachment clip, which got in the way when I was trying to spin the device in my hand, I think the Nano-mal is a solid first try at this kind of toy. Kids will love how cute they are, especially when you dress them up in the included clothes, which double as protective cases for the devices. And adults will appreciate them too: Parents are big on screen-free devices, while the young-at-heart will appreciate having something to keep their hands busy that isn’t their phone.</p> \n<p>The Nano-mals are available now at all major toy retailers, including <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3719d8d4-5edd-4817-998a-91f3229e7323&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f1960b1f-5003-451b-abd3-205b4b90cdf5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Walmart&amp;linkText=Walmart&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53YWxtYXJ0LmNvbS9zaG9wL25hbm9tYWxzIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJmMTk2MGIxZi01MDAzLTQ1MWItYWJkMy0yMDViNGI5MGNkZjUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhbG1hcnQuY29tL3Nob3AvbmFub21hbHMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVH8Mwa3CRYpfPmbdo30AsYW5pKVj07MBQqmCK3EpUoL&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fnanomals\">Walmart</a> and <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0DNG7729S&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=f1960b1f-5003-451b-abd3-205b4b90cdf5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Amazon&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAAcVQme3mNZu3WN4xReUtYJwZ06M1Eor51TJsxdIRjk-2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNANO-MALS-Stardream-Electronic-Responses-Interactive%2Fdp%2FB0DNG7729S\">Amazon</a>.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/hasbros-nano-mals-are-a-virtual-pet-that-rewards-fidgeting-141553387.html?src=rss",

So instead of watchOS 12, I’ve spent the past two weeks with the public beta of watchOS 26. The naming scheme shift is subtle, but helpful — which is how I’d describe the upgrades the new software brings to the Apple Watch. The AI-powered Workout Buddy better contextualizes your Fitness data and an added gesture gives the watch a fun trick that’s actually helpful. Other upgrades — including better smart replies and the Liquid Glass treatment — all combine to make the watch work and look a bit better than it did before. It’s not a game-changing shift, like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/ios-26-public-beta-is-available-to-download-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-iphone-and-ipad-update-135749331.html\">other OS 26 releases</a>, but it manages to make a great watch a touch better.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-luminous-liquid-glass\">Luminous Liquid Glass</h2>\n<p>Every Apple operating system got the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAEufKxgWteWNCu3R9pldJLME6Ik2e013731N1jiT3NntZJaG_DoowjYuTcFJADyOVagbkTD2n414zlqmwDrHUBEe7rWdtkotScjOaree7X0ti2EPpyS7W5tCyXVuC-ssLrpsXn2HlciPxCLjeIdZBCr5zYYH3aI8uj_PvkOJXEi\">Liquid Glass treatment</a> this year, including watchOS 26. The change is less noticeable on the Apple Watch than on the iPhone or iPad, though. You’ll notice the semi-transparent buttons and flowy movement when entering your password and opening the control center — the icons look like they’re surrounded in little drops of water, which is quite pretty. You’ll see it on the Photos watch face, too, especially if you select the “glass” color for the time readout.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"The time numerals get the Liquid Glass treatment with the Photos watch face. \" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/b788fde0-76d7-11f0-bdff-222bc9dc0f43\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>The Liquid Glass treatment for the Photos watch face.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>The Smart Stack now has a liminal glow and the app icons are likewise a touch more luminous than before. The effect is subtle and nicely unifies the look of the watch and its companion iPhone. Like all design upgrades, Liquid Glass made me feel like I was using a new watch — though, like everything, the novelty wore off after a week or two.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-revamped-workout-app-combines-ai-stats-with-a-dj\">Revamped Workout app combines AI stats with a DJ</h2>\n<p>In addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to. As someone who gets derailed from pretty much all my tasks when I have to interact with my phone, I appreciate anything that can make decisions for me and prevent me from reaching for it.</p>\n<p>I was presented with peppy beats that matched the cadence of my run, from bands and artists that were familiar as well as new-to-me selections that fit my tastes. Unfortunately, it didn’t always work correctly. Sometimes I’d get no music, other times the music would play but the Workout Buddy would fall silent. I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A person holds an apple watch 10 displaying the new workout app\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/a7ba9680-77b3-11f0-acfb-bc5c489c2f1a\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>The new Workout app layout.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>The new Workout Buddy is probably the biggest AI play in watchOS 26. It uses historical and real-time data collected by your watch to give you a window into how you’re performing at the beginning, end and throughout a workout. It works for walking, running, cycling and other workouts but requires headphones and a nearby Apple Intelligence-<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-intelligence-what-devices-and-features-will-actually-be-supported-185850732.html\">compatible</a> iPhone. That gave me pause. I hate carrying stuff and/or sticking things in my ears when I run. But after acquiring some open earbuds and digging out my old <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D3HWPZ85&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=012d64a0-674e-4646-8e36-d4ee0d9de2a5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Spibelt&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDNIV1BaODU_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMDEyZDY0YTAtNjc0ZS00NjQ2LThlMzYtZDRlZTBkOWRlMmE1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDNIV1BaODUiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUU3NfOtvYuctRlpN9eW700wJ1FbPL4M09KujCOg7Roj&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3HWPZ85\">Spibelt</a>, I made it work.</p>\n<p>There are three voices to choose from as of this writing, a bright feminine option, a British male-sounding one and another female-presenting version with a lower register. These were built on vocal data from Fitness+ trainers and have an authentic sound to them. At the start of a workout, you’ll get a brief pep talk along with some recent milestones. My pre-game walking and running talks included references to the day of the week, my location and accumulated fitness data. For example, “Way to get out there on a Wednesday morning walk in Albuquerque. So far this week, you’ve done three walking workouts. Let’s get in some steps!”</p>\n<p>Depending on the type of exercise, you can set target ranges for cadence, heart rate, speed, distance, power (cycling), time and others. During a workout, the AI will let you know if you’re at, below or above those levels. The first time I tried Workout Buddy, my run was quite lonely. I didn’t realize I had to turn on the Buddy, as well as the various goal metrics within the Workout app. I did that and, on my next run, the AI delivered cadence and heart rate updates, and let me know when I hit milestones like distance and duration.</p>\n<p>At the end of a workout, you’ll see a thinking animation as the AI assembles a summary. It’ll recap data like your pace, distance, average and peak heart rate, as well as progress on your Activity rings. It’ll also point out comparisons or cumulative milestones you may have hit. For example, after a longer walk, it told me that I’d just burned the most calories on a walk so far. Another day, it told me I’d walked ten miles so far this week. It closes the update by encouraging you to take the energy into the rest of your day or something similarly positive but measured.</p>\n<p>That’s a big improvement over the first few times I used the feature. My first few pep talks were cloying, telling me something along the lines of “It’s not easy to get out there early in the morning!” and “Your effort is inspiring!&quot; After I stopped a run early to fuss with settings, it told me I did a “Great job!” on a three-minute run. Thankfully, Apple appears to be tweaking the Buddy behind the scenes, calibrating the AI’s “personality.” Recent pep talks have become noticeably less sycophantic and therefore more enjoyable. I imagine the Buddy will only continue to evolve even more from here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-workout-buddy-is-not-a-coach\">The Workout Buddy is not a coach</h2>\n<p>The Workout Buddy is a motivational experience that provides personalized insights you can use to gauge your performance. But I just finished trying out <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-8-review-samsungs-best-smartwatch-in-years-155857108.html#:~:text=browsing%20your%20tiles.-,The%20running%20coach,-made%20me%20mad\">Samsung’s AI running coach</a> on the Galaxy Watch and couldn’t help comparing the two. That coach pushed me to run five kilometers for the first time in my life. The Buddy made me feel like I’d accomplished something special just by taking my dog on a stroll. Both have their place, but I’d say Apple’s version is probably best for those who already know what their goals are and what they need to do to hit them. Samsung’s version may be better for beginners who want some help shaping their fitness journey.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Buddy, the Workout app has a new look with icons in each of the four corners of the screen that give you easier access to adjust your data view, play music, set goals and tweak Buddy settings. My favorite new feature is in the music menu and it’s limited to Apple Music for now. If you tap the music icon, you have the option to auto-play music. From there, you can also select “Picked for you” or “Choose media.” The former will select music that matches the type of workout you’re doing and what you like to listen to.

I realize I’m testing a public beta of watchOS 26, so I’m holding out hope the feature will work at launch. Because when it worked, it was glorious.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-more-hands-free-fun-with-wrist-flick\">More hands-free fun with wrist flick</h2>\n<p>I love the double tap gesture Apple <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-is-now-live-with-double-tap--heres-how-to-customize-the-gesture-on-watchos-101-133021753.html\">introduced</a> with the Apple Watch Series 9 — it’s a pleasure to stop timers, start auto-detected workouts and answer calls without getting my other hand involved. But it took some practice before I could reliably get the watch to recognize the gesture. (The trick is raising your wrist in an exaggerated checking-the-time motion then quickly, but not too quickly, tapping your thumb and finger together twice.)</p>\n<p>Luckily, the new Wrist Flick motion introduced in watchOS 26 takes practically no effort to get right. It involves quickly turning the back of your wrist away from you and back up again. Doing that can silence a call, stop a ringing timer, dismiss notifications and return you to the watch face from any app you open. It also makes those <del>irritating</del> helpful “Time to stand!” reminders go away. The wrist flick doesn’t clear alerts, just dismisses them — so the red indicator dot disappears, but the notification remains and you can see it if you swipe down. Just note that it’s only available to Apple Watch Series 9, 10 and the Ultra 2.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"A demonstration of clearing notifications with the wrist flick gesture\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/11f22670-77ba-11f0-b6f9-6996b2529ca4\" style=\"height: 320px; width: 640px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>Wrist flick is a great feature — though it's important to note that Android wearables since WearOS 2 had a similar feature for a while now. And I’d like to see Apple adopt more hands-free interactions like this. Apple already has many gesture-based controls as part of its existing <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/assistivetouch-apdec70bfd2d/watchos\">AssistiveTouch</a> feature. Actions like fist clenches, wrist tilts and single or double taps can control most of the navigation on the watch. Unfortunately, turning on AssistiveTouch turns off the universal double tap feature. I’d be interested in seeing something that splits the difference. Perhaps four or five gestures for basic functions that can be used in conjunction with screen input.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-smarter-replies-could-make-messages-a-usable-watch-app\">Smarter replies could make Messages a usable watch app</h2>\n<p>The Apple Watch is great for reading texts, but replying is awkward. That tiny keyboard is an interface for ants — even talk-to-text input is inefficient as it’s tough to correct mistakes. Smart Replies are little canned responses that appear as suggestions below the reply field. Those aren’t new, but now Series 9 watches and later will use an improved on-device language model to come up with relevant bits of text you can send with a tap.</p>\n<p>In addition to the choices that are always offered — Okay, Yes, No, Thank you and Can I call you later? — I saw things like “Ok, let me know” and “That’s so sweet!” both of which applied to their respective conversations. I wasn’t always given Smart Reply suggestions, and some of them weren’t very relevant, but again, it’s a great feature that will save time when it works.</p>\n<p>Another Messages update is a carryover from iOS 26 (and borrowed from countless other messaging apps). You can now set custom backgrounds for each of your (Apple-only) contacts. Just note that whatever you set will be seen by all participants in the conversation, once they update to iOS 26. On your watch, the photo, gradient or pattern you pick carries over to your conversations. Not only does it look nice, I find backgrounds help me to not accidentally text my mom something I meant to send to my sister.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"You can apply different backgrounds to your conversations in Messages\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/b78924f0-76d7-11f0-97a3-d2837d663e80\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>Backgrounds are now available in Messages.&nbsp;</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-notes-have-arrived\">Notes have arrived</h2>\n<p>The Notes app is now on Apple Watch. I honestly hadn’t noticed the lack before this — I know there are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-only-thing-i-want-from-apples-big-2025-redesign-is-a-120023531.html\">Notes enthusiasts</a> out there, but in my world, Alexa handles all reminder and shopping list duties. Still, I can see how the new integration could come in handy. After creating a simple shopping checklist in the iOS Notes app, I opened the list on my watch while I was shopping and found it far easier to check things off on my wrist than dragging out my phone every time I stuck something in my cart.</p>\n<p>I’m curious to see whether Apple’s improved prediction algorithms for the new OS will eventually add Notes to my Smart Stack suggestions after I open the Notes app a few times at the grocery store. As it stands now, the Notes widget will pop up first in the Smart Stack if that’s the last app you used.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-rest-of-the-new-stuff\">The rest of the new stuff</h2>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-face-gallery\"><strong>Face Gallery</strong></h3>\n<p>The iPhone Watch app has a new look and now organizes watch faces by category instead of by name. Groupings include New, Clean, Data-rich, Photos and Health and Fitness, among others. It’s certainly an improvement, but one that makes you wonder why it wasn’t always like this.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The Watch Face gallery is categorized now.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/b78924f0-76d7-11f0-bfbd-132a621428bd\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>The Watch Face gallery is categorized now.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Amy Skorheim for Engadget</div></figure>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-adaptive-sound\"><strong>Adaptive sound</strong></h3>\n<p>Another nice-but-obvious update adjusts the volume of pings and beeps to fit the environment — quieter in a noiseless office and louder at a raucous BBQ. I set a timer to go off when I was quietly working at my desk and then again with loud music playing and I couldn’t really tell the difference. But that’s a hard metric for the humble human ear to judge. Again, this is a feature reserved for Series 9 models and later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-smart-stack\"><strong>Smart Stack</strong></h3>\n<p>The Smart Stack will now add a small prompt to your watch face when it detects certain situations. For example, if you open the camera app on your phone, a small camera icon appears at the bottom of your watch screen, as a suggestion to open the remote shutter. Apple gives other examples, such as showing the workout icon when you arrive at your usual pilates studio or the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/watch/use-backtrack-to-retrace-your-steps-apd25bfcec3f/watchos\">Backtrack</a> navigation feature when you journey away from cellular connectivity.</p>\n<p>I didn’t see the prompt very often, but I did notice that the Smart Stack rearranged itself according to my habits — such as putting the medication widget at the top of the stack right around the time it was time to take my prescription, or shuffling Shazam to the top when it hears music playing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-siri-is-still-siri\">Siri is still Siri</h2>\n<p>Coming fresh off of reviewing the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, I can’t help but notice a stark difference between that wearable’s fully integrated, AI-powered Gemini and Apple’s same-old Siri. Gemini on the Samsung watch helped me find new stuff in my city, performed convoluted tasks and answered some pretty esoteric questions. I use Siri on my watch to reliably set timers, text people and add events to my calendar. But it’s not quite on the level of Gemini’s contextually-aware, generative capabilities that can interact with multiple apps. Asking something like “Where should I have lunch?” gave me a list of businesses with lunch in the name followed by Siri asking me: “Which one?” Not sure what that meant. Gemini, on the other hand, gave me local and relevant ideas for places I’d actually want to eat.</p>\n<p>Even before AI swallowed everyone’s mind, I had a soft spot for digital assistants. When Alexa sings the “You’re very, very, oh so very welcome” song, I get a dopey smile on my face. I’ve tried to love Siri, but I get frustrated by being misunderstood, misdirected, misheard and flat-out ignored. I know Apple doesn’t like to release new tech until it’s fully up to snuff, and I’m looking forward to seeing what finally happens with new Siri. But for now, the disparity shows.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2>\n<p>The changes watchOS 26 brings to the Apple Watch are perhaps not as grand as those for other Apple devices. Liquid Glass here isn’t as all-encompassing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/ios-26-beta-preview-liquid-glass-is-better-than-you-think-172155402.html\">as it is on the iPhone</a>. The new watch features don’t make the wearable finally realize its full potential <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipados-26-preview-a-long-awaited-multi-tasking-update-pays-off-so-far-172522054.html\">like iPad OS 26</a> does for the tablet. And there isn’t one major feature upgrade that transforms the watch experience, like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-26-beta-preview-spotlights-time-to-shine-171700779.html\">macOS 26 does with Spotlight </a>on Macs.</p>\n<p>But the updates do push the experience of using the watch forward. Liquid Glass is pretty and nicely ties the wearable with its companion devices. The Workout app, which was already good at tracking fitness metrics, is even better with the Workout Buddy, providing stat summaries and automated playlists. Improved smart replies for Messages and the addition of the Notes app fix two of the watch’s previous shortcomings. And the wrist flick adds another option for hands-free interaction and — I hope — is a precursor to more such utility. I’m still holding out hope for an improved, personable and helpful Siri once Apple is ready, but for now, these are all welcome upgrades for what’s already the industry’s best overall smartwatch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/watchos-26-preview-its-the-little-things-140035949.html?src=rss",

      "summary": "<p>Even though the Switch 2 basically just came out, we're already starting to see discounts on some of its accessories. One of the more charming peripherals, the HORI Piranha Plant camera, is on sale right now for only $40. That's $20 off and a record-low price. It's a good deal for anyone who wants to take advantage of the Switch 2's camera functionality in games like <em>Mario Kart World</em> and that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/chillin-by-the-fire-is-a-relaxing-co-op-campfire-sim-thats-out-today-on-nintendo-switch-2-150009762.html\">recently-released campfire sim</a>.</p> \n<p>This was designed specifically for Nintendo's new console, so it's a plug-and-play affair. It's actually cheaper than the official Switch 2 camera with this sale and it looks a whole lot cooler. It's a Piranha Plant from the Mario franchise. We called it a \"work of art\" <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/horis-piranha-plant-switch-2-camera-is-a-work-of-art-194430377.html\">upon encountering the device</a> and that holds true today.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p> </p> \n<p>This thing is not only stylish, resembling an Amiibo more than a camera, but it's downright useful. The pot the Piranha Plant sits in functions as both a stand and USB extension for the device. The plant itself detaches from the pot, so the camera can be used in portable mode by popping it into the USB port at the top of the console.</p> \n<p>There's also a built-in privacy shutter. Just close the plant's mouth to obscure the lens. The actual camera specs here aren't going to win any awards, with a frame rate of 30FPS and a resolution of 640 x 480p. However, that's more than enough to capture footage of your floating head to accompany your kart as it races through the Mushroom Kingdom.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-hori-piranha-plant-camera-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-on-sale-for-33-percent-off-145031942.html?src=rss",

His company Terraform created a &quot;stablecoin&quot; called TerraUSD supposedly pegged to the US dollar, along with a floating crypto coin called Luna. When TerraUSD fell below its $1 peg in May of 2021, Kwon secretly arranged for a trading firm to buy the currency to boost its price.

He said most &quot;will want Auto,&quot; which is most likely the standard version that's already a reasoning model.

GPT-4o is now also back in the model picker for all paying users by default.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>OpenAI removed GPT-4o with the launch of GPT-5: The company significantly simplified ChatGPT because GPT-5 was supposed to offer a unified experience for users. However, its decision was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-brings-gpt-4o-after-users-melt-down-over-the-new-model-172523159.html\">met by criticism</a> from people who <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1mki5dm/removing_gpt4o_biggest_mistake_ever/\">preferred GPT-4o's personality</a> better, especially since it didn't give them notice that it was deprecating older models. In his post, Altman promised users that if the company ever does deprecate GPT-4o, OpenAI &quot;will give plenty of notice.&quot; In addition to the GPT-5 and GPT-4o models, users can toggle to &quot;Show additional models&quot; in ChatGPT web settings if they want to access o3, 4.1, and GPT-5 Thinking mini. GPT-4.5 is only available to subscribers paying for the $200-a-month Pro tier, though, because it &quot;costs a lot of GPUs.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Altman said that GPT-5 Thinking now has rate limits of 3,000 messages a week, after which users will only be able to use GPT-5 Thinking mini.

      "summary": "<p>I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.<br /><br />E-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-best-e-ink-tablets-for-2025\">Best E Ink tablets for 2025</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it\">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet\">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml#jump-link-other-e-ink-tablets-weve-tested\">Other E Ink tablets we've tested</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-e-ink-tablets-for-2025\">Best E Ink tablets for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-are-e-ink-tablets-worth-it\">Are E Ink tablets worth it?</h2> \n<p>An E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>The final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.</p> \n<p>Arguably the biggest reason why you <em>wouldn’t</em> want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-an-e-ink-tablet\">What to look for in an E Ink tablet</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-writing-and-latency\">Writing and latency</h3> \n<p>Arguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-reading\">Reading</h3> \n<p>How much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).</p> \n<p>The supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-scribe-updates-include-support-for-direct-on-page-writing-051753157.html\"> Kindle</a> or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.</p> \n<p>Also with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to<a href=\"https://www.ebook-converter.com/104-how-to-read-kindle-ebook-kobo.htm\"> bring those titles over to a third-party device</a>. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-search-functionality\">Search functionality</h3> \n<p>Most E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.</p> \n<p>Searching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sharing-and-connectivity\">Sharing and connectivity</h3> \n<p>While we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.</p> \n<p>None of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet <em>after</em> the tablet portion is done.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-price\">Price</h3> \n<p>E Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.</p> \n<p>E Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”</p> \n<p>As a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-e-ink-tablets-weve-tested\">Other E Ink tablets we've tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-lenovo-smart-paper\">Lenovo Smart Paper</h3> \n<p>Lenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-paper-review-a-solid-e-ink-tablet-spoiled-by-the-cost-133056534.html\">Smart Paper</a>, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-onyx-boox-tab-ultra\">Onyx Boox Tab Ultra</h3> \n<p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=57f41413-eec2-4d90-9c25-26d144b737b8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Boox+Tab+Ultra&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3Nob3AuYm9veC5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvdGFiIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1N2Y0MTQxMy1lZWMyLTRkOTAtOWMyNS0yNmQxNDRiNzM3YjgiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vc2hvcC5ib294LmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy90YWIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAb7A7EPvy3G8_cwM2BUU4bg4uNsVGQKK3o2yEjUAdhc2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.boox.com%2Fproducts%2Ftab\">Boox Tab Ultra</a> has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",

LG decided to carry over its most premium soundbars <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lg-s95tr-and-sg10ty-first-look-two-takes-on-wireless-dolby-atmos-for-home-theater-154551736.html\">from 2024</a>, but it will add the compact <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/lg-previews-the-compact-s20a-soundbar-at-ces-2025-191337487.html\">S20A</a> this year. The company only previewed the model at CES, so full specs are still forthcoming.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span> \n<p>Samsung will once again keep the same overall design and features for its top-end Q990 soundbar. However, the company is adding a few new tools and it drastically reduced the size of the wireless subwoofer that comes in the box. Samsung does have one new model for 2025, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/samsung-debuts-the-qs700f-soundbar-and-updates-the-q990-at-ces-2025-030042257.html\">the QS700F</a>, that’s designed to sit on a table or automatically adjust to being mounted flat on a wall. Details are scarce on that soundbar for now and I anticipate a full spec sheet when the company is really to sell it.</p> \n<p>Of the big three TV companies, Sony is the only one that didn’t announce any home theater gear at CES. The company has decided to focus mainly on its automotive efforts at the show recently, leaving TV and audio announcements for later in the year. The company debuted <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-debuts-bravia-theater-line-of-dolby-atmos-soundbars-and-speakers-160034176.html\">multiple soundbar options</a> in 2024 and a four-speaker setup for the living room in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-debuts-bravia-theater-line-of-dolby-atmos-soundbars-and-speakers-160034176.html\">Bravia Quad</a>. That said, it wouldn’t surprise me if Sony released new soundbars later in the year since its most recent models were only announced last April.</p> \n<p>One company I would keep an eye on is Sennheiser. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-review.html\">original Ambeo model</a> is nearly six years old and could use a refresh. The company has added <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-plus-sub-dolby-atmos-170353080.html\">medium</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-mini-review-excellent-and-expensive-183045244.html\">mini</a> options to the Ambeo lineup since then, but it would be nice to see a refined version of the largest model too. The original Ambeo soundbar is huge, so no matter how good it sounds, it will always be a tough sell for some people.</p> \n<p>Although I think it’s less likely, it’s also possible that Sonos has new soundbars this year. While the company’s next device will likely be the rumored set-top streaming box, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/what-is-sonos-sound-motion-technology-183313680.html\">Sound Motion tech</a> inside <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/sonos-arc-ultra-review-new-tech-powers-a-big-audio-upgrade-130011149.html\">the Arc Ultra</a> would offer a big improvement to bass performance in compact models like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html\">Beam</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ray-soundbar-review-130050814-130050448.html\">Ray</a>. The company may bring Sound Motion to standalone speakers first, but it’s destined for those smaller soundbars <em>eventually</em>.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-best-soundbars-for-2025\">The best soundbars for 2025</h2> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-\"></h2> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-soundbar\">What to look for in a soundbar</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-features\">Features</h3> \n<p>When it comes to features, the more you pay the more you're going to get in your new audio system. Most affordable options ($150 or less) will improve your television's audio quality, but that's about it. Step into the $300 to $400 range and you'll find all-in-one soundbars with things like built-in voice control, wireless connectivity, Google Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and even Android TV. They're all helpful when you want to avoid looking for the remote control, but the best playback quality is usually only in the top tier and the formats those premium soundbar systems support. I’m talking about things like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X and other high-resolution audio standards — essentials if you’re building a truly cinematic home entertainment setup. And not all Atmos soundbars are equal, so you'll need to look at the finer details carefully before you break into the savings account. If you're looking for one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, size, channels and subwoofer options will be important factors to consider. Some models even include a dedicated subwoofer to enhance bass performance, bringing an extra punch to action scenes and soundtracks.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-ports\">Ports</h3> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cfb15b20-e904-11eb-9f99-c08983de4f5c\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a big one. A lot of the more affordable soundbars are limited when it comes to connectivity options. They either offer an optical port or one HDMI jack and, if you're lucky, both. Things get slightly better in the mid-range section, but that's not always the case. The Sonos Beam, for example, is $449, but only has a single HDMI port. Even at the higher-end, the $899 Sonos Arc still only has one HDMI port. If you plan to connect multiple devices like a set-top box, gaming laptop or console directly to your soundbar for the best audio experience, you’ll want an option with at least two HDMI (eARC) inputs. HDMI connections are critical for supporting Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital audio formats, as well as high-res passthrough for HDR and 8K/4K content.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-channels\">Channels</h3> \n<p>Another big thing you’ll want to pay attention to when looking for the best soundbar is channels. That’s the 2.1, 7.1.2 or other decimal number that companies include in product descriptions. The first figure corresponds to the number of channels. A two would just be left and right while a more robust Atmos system, especially one with rear surround speakers, could be five or seven (left, right, center and upward). The second number refers to the dedicated subwoofer, so if your new soundbar comes with one or has them built in, you’ll see one here. The third numeral is up-firing speakers, important for the immersive effect of Dolby Atmos. Not all Atmos-enabled units have them, but if they do, the third number will tell you how many are in play and how they contribute to the overall soundstage.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wireless\">Wireless</h3> \n<figure> \n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cff960a0-e904-11eb-ad7a-7525dbfffb3a\" /> \n <figcaption></figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most soundbars these days offer either Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or both. When it comes to Wi-Fi, that connectivity affords you luxuries like voice control (either built-in or with a separate device), Chromecast, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2. Depending on your preferences, you might be able to live without some of these. For me, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast are essentials, but the rest I can live without. Those two give me the ability to beam music and podcasts from my go-to apps without having to settle for — or struggle with — a Bluetooth connection. For instance, Sonos speakers often offer seamless integration with iOS devices, making it easy to connect and stream music wirelessly. If you’re looking for a wireless speaker that can enhance your TV setup while also offering flexibility for audio throughout the house, it's worth considering a multi-room system.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-size\">Size</h3> \n<p>This one might seem obvious but humor me for a minute. Nothing is more soul-crushing than getting a pricey soundbar in your living room only to discover you have to rearrange everything to find a spot for it. This was my plight when the<a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B08J99R8WJ&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=e0a90d7f-849e-44f0-bc4d-8672c83d006d&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Sennheiser+Ambeo+Soundbar&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAATT-eD3Vxikh1Ox2eB9IcdUDMCrEFQYjLWpCtPt27sw-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSennheiser-AMBEO-Soundbar-5-1-4-Channel%2Fdp%2FB08J99R8WJ\"> Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar</a> arrived at my door. Yes, that speaker is absurdly large (and heavy), and most soundbars aren't nearly as big. I learned a valuable lesson: Make sure the space where you want to put a soundbar will accommodate the thing you're about to spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars on.</p> \n<p>Basically, it all comes down to the TV you have (or are planning to get) and what the primary goal is for your living-room audio. Is it ease of use? Do you want the best possible sound from a single speaker or speaker/sub combo? Do you just want to be able to actually hear your TV better? Or do you want a full home entertainment experience with crisp vocals, thunderous deep bass, and immersive surround system audio?</p> \n<p>By paying attention to each of those areas, you should have a good idea of what to look for in a soundbar, soundbar/subwoofer combo, Dolby Digital system or a more robust setup. With that said, we've put numerous products through their paces at Engadget and have a few favorites for best soundbar at various price points to get you started.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-soundbars-we-tested\">Other soundbars we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sony-bravia-theater-bar-6\">Sony Bravia Theater Bar 6</h3> \n<p>There’s a lot to like about the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/home-theater/sony-bravia-theater-bar-6-review-great-sound-greater-frustration-144512450.html\">Bravia Theater Bar 6</a>, Sony’s new midrange option in its soundbar lineup. Sound quality is the speaker’s best attribute, even though it’s limited by its 3.1.2-channel configuration. The biggest two issues with this model are the lack of Wi-Fi connectivity — which means no AirPlay, Chromecast or Spotify Connect — and the need to use your computer and a thumb drive to install firmware updates. Neither of those should be things you have to consider on a $650 soundbar in 2025.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sonos-arc\">Sonos Arc</h3> \n<p>There’s no doubt that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html\">the Arc</a> is Sonos’ best-sounding soundbar, but it’s also the company’s most expensive. With a new model based on the Arc <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/sonos-plans-400-500-headphones-tv-set-top-box-video-roam-2-new-sound-bar\">rumored to be on the way</a>, it’s difficult to recommend this product over the likes of Samsung and Sony. The Arc works well as both a soundbar and a speaker, and the device will fit in nicely with other Sonos gear you might already have for a multiroom setup. It only has one HDMI port though, where much of the competition allows you to connect streaming and gaming devices directly to their soundbars.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-plus\">Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus</h3> \n<p>I don’t think <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-plus-sub-dolby-atmos-170353080.html\">Sennheiser’s medium-sized model</a> offers enough to stand out from the more powerful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-review.html\">Ambeo Soundbar Max</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-ambeo-soundbar-mini-review-excellent-and-expensive-183045244.html\">Ambeo Soundbar Mini</a>. The Mini is more affordable and does a solid job with immersive audio in its own right. Like the rest of the Ambeo lineup, there’s no option for satellite speakers as you can only add a subwoofer to the soundbars. However, the Ambeo Soundbar Plus does have RCA input, so you can use it with a turntable if you’re into vinyl.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-soundbar-faqs\">Best soundbar FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-a-soundbar-better-than-speakers\">Is a soundbar better than speakers?</h3> \n<p>It really depends on what you’re after. A soundbar is definitely a simpler, more compact solution compared to a full speaker setup. If you want better sound than your TV’s built-in setup but don’t want to deal with multiple speakers and wires everywhere, a soundbar is probably the way to go. Some soundbars can even deliver impressive surround sound effects, thanks to features like Dolby Atmos and virtual audio technology.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, if you’re an audiophile or want true surround sound for an at-home theater experience, a multi-speaker setup with a receiver, surround speakers and subwoofer will give you a richer soundstage and more control over your experience.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-connection-do-i-need-for-a-soundbar\">What connection do I need for a soundbar?</h3> \n<p>Most modern soundbars connect to your TV via HDMI ARC or eARC, which is the easiest and best option for achieving high-quality audio. If your TV supports this, all you need is an HDMI cable, and you’ll get not only great sound but also some extra features like controlling the soundbar with your TV remote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If HDMI ARC isn’t an option on your TV, you can use an optical cable, which also delivers solid audio quality. Some soundbars even offer Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections for streaming music, and a few still have a 3.5mm aux jack for connecting to older devices.&nbsp;</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-all-soundbars-come-with-subwoofers\">Do all soundbars come with subwoofers?</h3> \n<p>Not all soundbars come with subwoofers, but many do or at least offer one as an optional add-on that you can purchase separately. A subwoofer is what gives you that deep, booming bass, so if you like action movies or want a fuller sound for music, having one can make a big difference. Some soundbars have a built-in subwoofer, but these generally don’t provide the same punch as a separate one.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-soundbars-143041791.html?src=rss",

Plus, it lacked street visibility.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By fate, though, they found a suitable store location in Taman Kota Laksamana.

Case in point: in 2024, the FCA fined HSBC £6.2mn for not properly treating customers in financial difficulty.

As sunshine bathes the leafy university campus, scientists inside the labs work under cool fluorescent light. Clad in green protective gear, they tend meticulously to test tubes within hermetically sealed cleanrooms. The containers hold the fruits of today’s labour: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Each cell is barely a quarter the width of a human hair but wields remarkable power. MSCs reduce inflammation, repair damaged tissue, and modulate the immune system. They can treat chronic diseases and delay ageing. They may even prevent illness before it begins. But to become a mainstay&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/cellcolabs-stem-cell-scale-inflection-point?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",

Or seismic activity sensors built for construction that go on to detect submarines underwater. These ideas represent the promise of dual-use technologies that serve both civilian and military purposes. For the first time, the European Commission is explicitly proposing to fund them through programmes such as Horizon Europe. But as we race to embrace dual-use technologies, we face a pivotal choice: continue the old model where military applications drive innovation that civilians later adopt, or turn this paradigm on its head? Technological innovation has long followed a well-trodden&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/civilian-first-innovation-dual-use-technologies?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",

But he’s begun to wonder if candidates’ answers are genuine, even on video calls. “I can see their eyes shifting across the screen,” he says. “Then they come back with the perfect answer to a question.” The trust gap between employer and jobseeker is widening, and it’s fast becoming one of the trickiest knots in modern hiring. From ChatGPT-polished CVs to full-blown applications submitted by bots, GenAI has hit the job market hard and gone fully mainstream.

Then there is Asia — with China’s rapid developments and Japan and South Korea’s deep legacy in robotics. Headlines still gravitate toward billion-dollar budgets, rapid hardware iterations, and slick simulation reels.  Behind the noise, though, another development is unfolding in Europe — quieter, but potentially far more consequential. The next chapter of humanoid robotics may be defined not by who moves first or builds the flashiest prototypes, but by who moves with the discipline&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/europe-humanoid-robotics-strategy?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",

The Data Protection Act, the GDPR, and the recent AI Act — aligned more closely with local workers’ laws and unions — have set the continent on a separate path.  A recent joint study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Poland’s National Research Institute (NASK) found that Europe — along with Asia — tops the list of most exposed regions to AI, far surpassing the Americas.
