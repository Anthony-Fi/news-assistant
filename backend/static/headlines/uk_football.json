Defensive issues are not exclusive to Andoni Iraola before the Premier League opener, however. Arne Slot voiced concern over the champions’ pre-season vulnerability before and after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/10/crystal-palace-liverpool-community-shield-match-report\">Community Shield against Crystal Palace</a>, when the absence of Ryan Gravenberch for family reasons was keenly felt. “Three times we lost the ball very simple in our midfield and three times they could counterattack us,” reflected the Liverpool head coach. Gravenberch will be missing again on Friday due to suspension but Slot expects the team with the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season to react as soon as the serious business begins. “Mixed teams, new players coming in, Virgil [van Dijk] being sick, Alisson not being there,” he listed as reasons for Liverpool’s recent difficulties on Thursday. “But all of this is not an excuse when we start the league.

That was the day Manchester United outplayed and outviolenced Arsenal in the first leg of their Milk Cup semi-final at Highbury. United won 4-2; they were 4-0 up after 80 minutes before taking their foot off Arsenal’s throat, and shinbone, and head. “Perhaps we’ve been concentrating too much on passing and technique,” lamented Don Howe, Arsenal’s head coach and assistant <em>to </em>the manager, Terry Neill. “Against United we went out to strike the ball about instead of putting some meat into the game.” In 1980s English football, there was no place for veganism. Things have changed since the days when ABH was a bookable offence, and only then after the first 10 minutes, but English football still has a pretty noxious meat footprint.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/14/wayne-rooney-tom-brady-and-a-serving-of-ultra-processed-beef\">Continue reading...</a>",

In what feels like a high-quality production, the 2022 World Cup winner struts around the city in 1970s clobber: a leather jacket, an enormously lappelled shirt and a vintage pair of Copa Mundials, all to the sound of the Bee Gees’ Stayin’ Alive. The context of this transfer to the Serie B side is that Gómez is finishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/22/world-cup-winner-papu-gomez-denies-wrongdoing-after-two-year-doping-ban\">a two-year doping ban</a> after taking a banned substance, which the now 37-year-old claimed came from his son’s cough medicine. Gómez, fifth on the all-time list of Serie A assists, continues to train independently but can start training with his new Padova teammates on 19 August.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/10/the-best-transfer-announcements-of-the-summer-window-and-the-worst\">Continue reading...</a>",

Actually, no, Nico, my younger brother crashed it … it was crap, though, it didn’t even have a radio.” Still, who grew up in Grez-Doiceau, near Brussels, laughs as he recounts his days driving to work as an unpaid video analyst at Sint-Truiden while living at home with his mother, Jane. “Best time of my life, to be honest. It was like the dream was coming true.”</p><p>Twelve years on, the 32-year-old, one of the most intriguing managers in the game, has been tasked with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/25/southampton-appoint-will-still-as-manager-on-three-year-contract\">returning Southampton to the Premier League</a> after impressing with Lens. The only other time he lived in England was as a teenager when he spent two years studying at Myerscough College in Lancashire, where his degree included coaching Preston’s under-14s. At the time Still felt like “the little posh Belgian kid” but that period provided a handy lesson in English football-speak.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/08/southamptons-will-still-ive-always-stuck-out-footballs-helped-me-integrate\">Continue reading...</a>",

There were glaring misses, falling-outs and some telling contributions in between, before it ended with Liverpool taking a rare financial hit on a one-time club record signing. Darwin Núñez never reached the heights Jürgen Klopp predicted he would, but it was an eventful three-year ride that ensures the striker is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/07/darwin-nunez-al-hilal-liverpool-agree-fee\">poised to depart</a> in the affections of many at Liverpool.</p><p>Klopp led the signing of Núñez before and especially after his two appearances for Benfica against Liverpool in the 2021-22 Champions League. But he was not the only Liverpool coach to be sold on the Uruguay international’s talents, become frustrated by attempts to accommodate the forward and ultimately sideline him. Arne Slot followed an identical path with the mercurial 26-year-old.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/07/darwin-nunez-liverpool-al-hilal-transfer-analysis\">Continue reading...</a>",

However, the Switzerland forward’s reasons for signing a three-year deal with FC Como Women, she says, have a deeper meaning.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/fc-como-alisha-lehmann-juventus-womens-football-serie-a\">Continue reading...</a>",

After progressing through her local boys’ team, playing for Eintracht Frankfurt for six years and thriving at youth level for Germany, Martinez most recently collected the Women’s Super League’s Rising Star award for the 2024-25 season after a breakthrough second half of the campaign in which she scored 10 times in 12 WSL games.</p><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our free weekly email, Moving the Goalposts.
